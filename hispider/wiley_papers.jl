This paper discusses the relevant conceptual and methodological issues\n            and reviews applications to air and water pollution, noise nuisance, climate parameters,\n            and natural hazards.\n1.\u2002Introduction\nA fundamental question in the study of environment and pollution is how environmental\n            conditions affect human well\u2010being. The issue is important because adverse effects\n            on well\u2010being of poor environmental quality provide a major rationale for environmental\n            management and regulation.\n1\nAt a more specific level, a question that arises with respect to the effects of environmental\n            quality on well\u2010being is how individuals value these effects. Environmental valuation\n            \u2013 in monetary terms \u2013 is a basic ingredient to the cost\u2013benefit analysis of environmental\n            policy.\nResearchers and environmental agencies use a number of standard tools to estimate\n            the costs of pollution or, equivalently, the benefits of public policies that reduce\n            pollution. These include hedonic regressions (housing prices are higher and wages\n            are lower in clean areas), travel cost models (people incur greater costs to get to\n            more pristine recreation sites), and contingent valuation approaches (simply asking\n            people how much they would be willing to pay for a specific improvement in environmental\n            conditions).\nIn addition to these standard methods of environmental valuation, a novel approach\n            has recently emerged, which is referred to as the \u2018happiness approach\u2019. The fundamental\n            idea is to use survey data on self\u2010rated happiness, and to model individuals' happiness\n            as a function of their incomes and the prevailing environmental conditions (controlling\n            for demographic and other relevant circumstances). The estimated relationship is then\n            used to calculate the trade\u2010off people would be willing to make between income and\n            environmental conditions, i.e. the increase in income necessary to compensate individuals\n            for any given decline in environmental quality.\nWhile the basic idea of the happiness approach is simple, the theoretical and empirical\n            details may be complex, and they may vary from application to application. In the\n            light of this, the purpose of the present paper is twofold. First, it provides a comprehensive\n            discussion of the relevant conceptual and methodological issues. Second, against this\n            background, it reviews the most important applications of the happiness approach to\n            a variety of environmental phenomena.\nA general finding from our discussion is that the happiness approach avoids some of\n            the difficulties of the standard valuation methods, but nevertheless has its own set\n            of weaknesses. Some of these originate from inadequacies of available databases and\n            may therefore be overcome in the future. In spite of these caveats, the applications\n            reviewed in this paper suggest that the happiness approach is capable of yielding\n            meaningful results, and that it may be important at least as a complement to and validation\n            test of standard valuation tools.\nThe paper is structured as follows.\nSection 2\ndiscusses the problem of environmental valuation and the relevant standard approaches;\n            it describes and assesses the happiness approach as an alternative valuation technique.\nSection 3\ndiscusses methodological issues relating to the required happiness data, environmental\n            data, income data, as well as the matching between them.\nSection 4\nsurveys applications of the happiness approach to the valuation of air pollution,\n            water pollution, noise, climate conditions, and natural hazards; it categorizes these\n            applications in terms of various methodological dimensions.\nSection 5\nconcludes.\n2.\u2002Conceptual Framework\n2.1\nValuing Environmental Conditions\nIn contrast to marketable goods, whose value can be inferred from observed market\n               data under some mild assumptions, the public\u2010good characteristics of many environmental\n               goods prevent their value from being identified directly from observation. As stated\n               in the introduction, the happiness approach constitutes a novel and potentially effective\n               tool for environmental valuation. By correlating people's reported subjective well\u2010being\n               (happiness, life satisfaction, experienced utility)\n2\nwith both income and environmental conditions, it evaluates these conditions directly\n               in terms of happiness as well as indirectly relative to income.\nTo put the approach in perspective, it is useful to refer to more familiar techniques\n               of environmental valuation (see\nO'Connor and Spash (1999)\n,\nFreeman (2003)\nfor detailed expositions). These are usually classified into\nrevealed preference\nand\nstated preference\nmethods. The former use complementarity or substitutability relationships between\n               environmental goods and market goods to infer the value attributed to environmental\n               conditions from observed behavior with respect to market goods. Examples include the\n               defensive behavior and damage cost method, hedonic price analysis, and the travel\n               cost approach. In the stated preference approach, individuals are directly asked to\n               value the environmental good in question. The most prominent stated preference method\n               is contingent valuation, which attempts to elicit the valuation of hypothetical changes\n               in environmental conditions.\nThe\ndefensive and damage cost method\nrefers to the actual costs induced by environmental degradation. While the defensive\n               costs include those expenses which the affected individuals incur to protect themselves\n               against worsening environmental conditions, the damage costs represent the monetary\n               value of the adverse effects that remain in spite of defensive behavior. Damage costs\n               mostly refer to physical property or human health and lives lost, but also include\n               income forgone due to environmental changes.\nAccording to the\nhedonic pricing approach\n, housing prices and wage rates reflect the environmental conditions in the respective\n               locations or time periods. The corresponding differentials in housing prices and wage\n               rates serve as implicit prices of differences in environmental quality and reflect,\n               in equilibrium, the individuals' marginal willingness to pay for better environmental\n               conditions. The hedonic pricing method is applicable to local environmental quality,\n               since it relies on spatial variation in prices (wages) and environmental conditions.\nThe\ntravel cost method\nuses the costs people incur to get to environmentally attractive locations as approximations\n               of the underlying valuation. Costs include not only actual expenses, but also the\n               opportunity costs of the time spent. The travel cost method is usually applied to\n               recreation sites.\nThe\ncontingent valuation method\n, being the most widespread stated preference technique, asks people to state their\n               willingness to pay for a hypothetical but well\u2010defined environmental improvement,\n               or the monetary compensation they require to accept a well\u2010defined environmental deterioration\n               (willingness to accept). The contingent valuation method can be applied to any kind\n               of environmental conditions, provided the hypothetical changes in these conditions\n               can be described with sufficient accuracy.\nAn assessment of the standard methods in relation to the happiness approach to valuation\n               will be provided in\nSection 2.4\n.\n2.2\nHappiness in Economics\nData on self\u2010reported well\u2010being are used in a growing literature in economics which\n               treats subjective well\u2010being as an empirical approximation to utility. An early paper\n               by\nEasterlin (1974)\nstudied the connection between income growth and self\u2010rated happiness in the USA.\n               Later contributions examined the relationship between income distribution and happiness\n               (\nMorawetz\net al.\n, 1977\n) and between unemployment and happiness (\nClark and Oswald, 1994\n;\nWinkelmann and Winkelmann, 1998\n).\nDi Tella\net al.\n(2001)\nused data from happiness surveys to estimate the trade\u2010off between inflation and\n               unemployment in the framework of a macroeconomic social welfare function. The number\n               of happiness\u2010related papers published in\nEconLit\njournals has increased continuously, from just four in 1991\u20131995 to more than 100\n               in 2001\u20132005 (\nKahneman and Krueger, 2006\n). Surveys on the use of happiness data in economics have appeared in the\nJournal of Economic Literature\n(\nFrey and Stutzer, 2002\n), the\nJournal of Economic Perspectives\n(\nDi Tella and MacCullough, 2006\n) and the\nNew Palgrave Dictionary of Economics\n(\nGraham, 2008\n). None of these papers has addressed the use of happiness data as a valuation technique\n               for public goods or bads.\nData on individuals' subjective well\u2010being are elicited in large\u2010scale surveys. Some\n               of the relevant surveys refer to single countries, such as the\nGeneral Social Surveys\nin the USA or the\nGerman Socio\u2010Economic Panel\n. Others, like the\nEurobarometer Surveys\nor the\nWorld Values Surveys\nuse a common format for eliciting subjective well\u2010being for several countries. In\n               addition to subjective well\u2010being, all of the relevant surveys provide the respondents'\n               most important socio\u2010demographic characteristics (especially sex, age, household size,\n               marital and occupational status, educational attainment, income). The surveys are\n               usually conducted regularly, where each consecutive wave draws on a new, representative\n               sample. An exception is the\nGerman Socio\u2010Economic Panel\n, in which the same set of people is surveyed repeatedly.\nThe questions pertaining to subjective well\u2010being may refer to \u2018happiness\u2019 or to \u2018life\n               satisfaction\u2019, and the categories may be purely verbal or may combine verbal with\n               numerical features. For instance, the\nGeneral Social Surveys\nuse a three\u2010point verbal happiness scale. It asks the question: \u2018Taken all together,\n               how would you say things are these days \u2013 would you say that you are very happy, pretty\n               happy, or not too happy?\u2019 The\nEurobarometer Surveys\nuse a four\u2010point verbal life satisfaction scale, employing the question: \u2018On the\n               whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all\n               satisfied with the life you lead?\u2019 In the\nWorld Values Surveys\n, people are offered a scale from 1 (dissatisfied) to 10 (satisfied) to respond to\n               the question: \u2018All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole\n               these days?\u2019\nTable 1\nsummarizes key parameters of some of the major sources of happiness data. The nature\n               and scientific quality of happiness data will be discussed in\nSection 3.2\nbelow.\nTable 1.\nKey Parameters of Selected Happiness Surveys.\nSurvey\nConcept of well\u2010being\nType of scale\nGeographical coverage\nPanel structure\nGeneral Social Surveys\nHappiness\n3\u2010point verbal\nUSA\nNo\nGerman Socio\u2010Economic Panel\nHappiness\n11\u2010point numerical\nGermany\nYes\nEurobarometer Surveys\nLife satisfaction\n4\u2010point verbal\nEuropean Union member countries\nNo\nWorld Values Surveys\nLife satisfaction\n10\u2010point numerical\nMore than 80 countries\nNo\nResearch on happiness has identified a number of covariates of happiness that explain\n               observed happiness patterns. They are important to include as controls in happiness\n               regressions aimed at environmental valuation, in order to avoid spurious correlations.\nRelevant covariates can be classified into factors at the micro (individual) level\n               and factors at the macro (societal) level. Important factors at the micro level are\n               health, age, sex, marital status, the size and structure of the household, the education\n               level, personal income, the employment status, and the degree of urbanization. With\n               respect to these covariates, there exist some robust relationships. While health is\n               of evident importance for happiness, the role of age is ambiguous: the relationship\n               between age and happiness is usually found to be negative until the age of just under\n               50, after which the relationship turns positive. Women usually report higher happiness\n               scores than men. Married people are happier than singles, whereas divorced, separated\n               or widowed persons are less happy. A larger household size or number of children go\n               along with less happiness, whereas higher education levels are associated with more\n               happiness. The latter holds even controlling for income, which by itself plays a positive\n               role. Being unemployed stands in a strong negative association with happiness, which\n               is true even when income is controlled for. Finally, people tend to be the more unhappy\n               the bigger the city in which they live.\nAt the macro level, important factors that have been studied and found important are\n               the general unemployment rate, the inflation rate and the growth rate. While happiness\n               is negatively linked to the unemployment and inflation rate, the relationship to the\n               growth rate is positive. The negative association between happiness and the unemployment\n               rate is valid even when the individual employment status is controlled for. In this\n               sense, high general unemployment is a social bad, presumably because it acts as an\n               indicator for the risk of becoming unemployed even if not actually out of work.\nThough these relationships are fairly robust, the factors mentioned explain only a\n               small fraction of the inter\u2010personal variation in stated happiness (usually not more\n               than 25%).\n2.3\nThe Happiness Approach as a Valuation Tool\nWhile much of the happiness literature in economics has been concerned with micro\u2010economic\n               and macro\u2010economic determinants of happiness, another obvious application is to use\n               data on subjective well\u2010being for a direct evaluation of environmental conditions\n               (or other public goods or bads). By measuring the marginal (dis)utility of environmental\n               conditions as well as the marginal utility of income, the trade\u2010off between them can\n               be determined, thus yielding a monetary valuation of the environment.\nThe appropriate happiness function can be stated as follows:\n(1)\nwhere\nW\nijt\nis the stated subjective well\u2010being of respondent\ni\nin location\nj\nat date\nt\n,\nQ\njt\ndescribes environmental conditions in location\nj\nat date\nt\n, and\nM\nijt\nis respondent\ni\n's income.\nX\njt\ncomprises a set of happiness\u2010relevant factors at the macro level,\nD\nijt\na set of observed individual\u2010level determinants of happiness, and\nU\nijt\na set of unobserved individual\u2010level determinants. The happiness function can be\n               taken as an operationalization of an indirect utility function. As such, it may include,\n               in addition, price variables.\n3\nAmong the observed individual\u2010level determinants\nD\nijt\nare the socio\u2010demographic factors discussed in the preceding section. Unobserved\n               characteristics\nU\nijt\ncan be the source of omitted variable bias (see\nSection 3.4\n).\nOnce estimated, the happiness function can be used to derive a monetary valuation\n               of changes in environmental conditions. Adopting for a while the simplified notation\nW\n=\nF\n(\nQ\n,\nM\n), one can totally differentiate this equation, set\ndW\n= 0, and solve for the marginal value (\nMV\n) of environmental conditions:\n(2)\nIn this formulation,\nMV\nwill be positive if\nQ\nmeasures environmental quality and negative if it measures environmental nuisance.\n               Accordingly, d\nM\n/d\nQ\n, i.e. the slope of the indifference curve in the\nM\n\u2013\nQ\nplane, will be negative or positive, respectively. The absolute value of\nMV\nis the marginal rate of substitution between environmental conditions and income.\nMV\nis invariant with respect to monotonically increasing transformations of well\u2010being.\nMV\nrepresents the utility\u2010constant valuation of marginal changes in environmental conditions,\n               i.e. the amount of income necessary to compensate people for a marginal change in\n               environmental quality while keeping subjective well\u2010being constant. If\nnon\u2010marginal\nchanges are to be valued, the Hicksian welfare measures can be employed. The appropriate\n               measures are the compensating variation\nCV\nand the equivalent variation\nEV\n(see\nJohansson, 1987\n). The compensating variation is the amount by which \u2013\nex post\nof an environmental change \u2013 income would need to be raised or reduced to fix well\u2010being\n               at its\nex ante\nlevel. The equivalent variation is the amount by which income would need to be adjusted\n               to attain the level of well\u2010being\nex post\nof an environmental change \u2013 if the change did not take place.\nDenoting a change in environmental conditions by \u0394\nQ\n,\nCV\nand\nEV\nare implicitly defined as follows:\n(3)\n(4)\nBoth\nCV\nand\nEV\nwill be positive if the environmental change represents an improvement and negative\n               if it represents deterioration. Just like\nMV\n, both of these non\u2010marginal welfare measures are independent of the way subjective\n               well\u2010being is cardinalized.\nCV\nand\nEV\nare illustrated in\nFigure 1\n. Let A, located on indifference curve\nI\nA\n, be the initial situation. If environmental quality improves by \u0394\nQ\n, this implies a move to B, located on indifference curve\nI\nB\n.\nCV\n, which takes the individual back to\nI\nA\n(at point C), is\nF\n\u2013\nE\n.\nEV\n, which takes the individual from A on\nI\nA\nto\nI\nB\nwhile holding environmental quality constant (point D), is\nG\n\u2013\nF\n. If, conversely, B is the initial situation and a deterioration to A takes place,\n               the associated\nCV\nis\nF\n\u2013\nG\n, whereas\nEV\nis\nE\n\u2013\nF\n.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nCompensating Variation and Equivalent Variation.\nCaption\nCompensating Variation and Equivalent Variation.\nThe happiness approach to environmental valuation can be extended to the case when\n               environmental change affects well\u2010being not only directly, but also indirectly through\n               an impact on income. Such impacts may be of a physical nature, if environmental variables\n               affect output (see\nWelsch, 2007\n;\nCarroll\net al.\n, 2009\n), or of a monetary nature, if environmental conditions are reflected in wages as\n               suggested by the hedonic valuation approach (\nFrijters and Van Praag, 1998\n).\nLet the dependence of income on environmental conditions be captured by\n(5)\nwhere\nZ\ndenotes determinants of income other than environmental conditions (i.e. production\n               inputs). Then, the total marginal value,\nTMV\n, of an environmental change equals the marginal income compensation for the environmental\n               change (i.e.\nMV\n) plus the marginal effect on income of environmental change:\n(6)\nDepending on the sign of \u2202\nG\n/\u2202\nQ\n,\nTMV\nmay be larger or smaller in magnitude than\nMV\n.\n4\nIf\nnon\u2010marginal\nenvironmental changes are to be valued in the presence of effects on income, analogues\n               to the Hicksian measures can be employed, which may be referred to as total compensating\n               variation (\nTCV\n) and total equivalent variation (\nTEV\n). Their implicit definitions can be stated as follows:\n(7)\n(8)\nIt may be noted that\nTCV\n(\nTEV\n) is not simply the sum of\nCV\n(\nEV\n) and the environment\u2010related income change, unless the well\u2010being function is linear\n               in\nQ\nand\nM\n. Both of these measures will be positive if the environmental change represents an\n               overall improvement and negative if it represents an overall deterioration. However,\n               it may be the case that the direct effect and the indirect effect are opposite in\n               sign, for instance if pollution acts as a quasi\u2010input to production.\n5\nIn that case,\nTCV\nand\nTEV\nmeasure the net welfare effect, whose sign is ambiguous.\n6\n2.4\nRelationship to Standard Approaches\nThe standard approaches and the happiness approach to non\u2010market valuation both have\n               their shortcomings.\n7\nThe\ndefensive and damage cost methods\nare incomplete, since they refer only to those costs actually incurred, in terms\n               of protection and mitigating costs, health costs, lives lost, damage to property,\n               and income forgone. They do not capture intangible costs, such as those related to\n               aesthetic values or the suffering from being sick. In that sense they represent a\n               lower bound on overall costs of environmental degradation. Furthermore, the sum of\n               observed defensive and damage costs may be biased unless it reflects the\noptimal\nlevel of defensive behavior.\nThe\nhedonic pricing method\nis superior because it can potentially capture all effects of environmental conditions\n               of which the individual is aware. However, it relies on assumptions of Walrasian general\n               equilibrium economics which have been questioned in a large literature (\nGowdy, 2007\n). In particular, it relies on optimal adjustment of market behavior to environmental\n               conditions. The method thus neglects information asymmetries as well as transaction\n               and moving costs which may prevent optimal adjustment. It also presumes perfect functioning\n               of markets, especially the absence of regulation, while in fact regulation is a characteristic\n               of housing and labor markets in many countries. Finally, the hedonic method may be\n               subject to sorting bias, as people most averse to poor environmental conditions choose\n               to live in more favorable locales.\nThe main drawback of the\ntravel cost method\nis its restricted applicability to a small subset of environmental goods, namely\n               recreation sites. In addition, application of the travel cost method may be rather\n               costly and time consuming.\nWhile the travel cost method is limited in terms of applicability,\ncontingent valuation\ncan be applied to all kinds of environmental conditions, in principle. In practice,\n               however, several issues need careful consideration. In the first place, contingent\n               valuation is concerned with hypothetical changes in environmental conditions. These\n               environmental changes need to be unambiguously presented to the persons participating\n               in a contingent valuation study. For example, to value improved air quality in California,\n               people were shown photographs of the sky with clean and dirty air (\nLoehman\net al.\n, 1985\n). To place a monetary value on such changes presents people with an unfamiliar and\n               cognitively complicated task of affective forecasting which may result in elicitation\n               of attitudes rather than preferences (\nKahneman and Sugden, 2005\n). Contingent valuation is subject to framing effects and context effects. In particular,\n               it matters whether valuation questions are formulated in terms of willingness to pay\n               (WTP) for gains or willingness to accept (WTA) losses. While the differences should\n               be small according to standard models of consumer choice (\nHanemann, 1991\n), behavioral economics has consistently shown that, due to the so\u2010called endowment\n               effect, the valuation of losses is systematically larger than the valuation of gains\n               (\nKnetsch, 2005\n).\n8\nMoreover, in addition to this \u2018generic\u2019 disparity, strategic responses may further\n               widen the gap (depending on the particular payment scheme which is an integral part\n               of the contingent valuation design) As to context (and disregarding the WTA\u2013WTP disparity),\n               it was found (in the case of woodland conservation) that WTP can vary considerably\n               solely because the interviewer is more formally dressed (\nBateman and Mawby, 2004\n).\n9\nThe\nhappiness approach\nto non\u2010market valuation is different from both the revealed and the stated preference\n               approaches. It is much more direct than the revealed preference methods in that it\n               relies on surveys of people's well\u2010being. However, it is not as direct as the contingent\n               valuation approach in that it does not ask people how they value environmental conditions.\n               Instead, well\u2010being scores elicited in surveys are correlated with people's incomes\n               and observed measures of environmental conditions, and these correlations serve to\n               estimate the trade\u2010offs people are willing to make between money and environmental\n               conditions.\nThe happiness technique avoids not only the specific difficulties of the particular\n               standard approaches (especially, stringent assumptions concerning the rationality\n               of agents and the functioning of markets in the revealed preference case, and the\n               use of hypothetical scenarios which may entail unreliable results and strategic behavior\n               in the stated preference case). It also avoids a fundamental problem common to all\n               standard approaches: while the standard methods rely on at least some knowledge of\n               cause\u2013effect relationships on the part of the individuals, the happiness approach\n               is able to capture all effects of a change in environmental conditions, even though\n               the individual may not be consciously aware of them. For instance, exposure to nuclear\n               radiation can damage health through a process unnoticed by the people, but which nevertheless\n               affects subjective well\u2010being. Similar reasoning applies to effects of air pollution.\n10\nThe circumstance that less knowledge is required is one reason why the happiness approach\n               is cognitively less demanding than the standard approaches. Another reason is that\n               people are not requested to perform the unfamiliar task of actively placing monetary\n               values on environmental conditions.\nKahneman and Sugden (2005)\nmake a strong point for the use of happiness (experienced utility) in environmental\n               valuation, on the presupposition that goods have value by virtue of their capacity\n               to create pleasurable affective states. While this assumption may be questionable\n               in some cases of pure existence value, for most environmental goods, experienced utility\n               is a source of value. Therefore, the happiness approach can capture several aspects\n               of environmental conditions, ranging from non\u2010monetized health to aesthetic values,\n               ecological effects, altruism, consequences of correlated pollutants, and income losses.\n               In addition, since the preference function is estimated directly, the happiness approach\n               permits not only marginal but also non\u2010marginal effects to be valued in a straightforward\n               manner. This is important since many environmental issues discussed in the literature\n               are non\u2010marginal (a development next door, a hog farm nearby, an oil spill, air pollution\n               episodes, climate change, flood events).\n11\nGiven its advantages, the happiness approach may serve as a valuable addition to the\n               toolbox of non\u2010market valuation. By treating income as potentially endogenous, effects\n               of environmental conditions on wages (in the spirit of the hedonic valuation technique)\n               can be incorporated into the analysis. In addition, if housing prices depend on environmental\n               conditions, the happiness function can be extended to include these prices. Combining\n               the extended happiness function with the hedonic housing price function then permits\n               compensated environmental nuisance to be differentiated from non\u2010compensated environmental\n               nuisance.\n3.\u2002Empirical Methodology\nIn spite of its advantages at a conceptual level, the happiness approach has its own\n            set of weaknesses and raises a number of methodological issues. These will be addressed\n            below.\n3.1\nEstimating Equation\nApplication of the happiness approach requires, in the first place, specifying an\n               appropriate estimating equation that captures the relationships described by the general\n               happiness function introduced above. A common specification has the following structure:\n(9)\nThis specification is a linearized version of\nequation (1)\n.\n12\nIn comparison with\nequation (1)\n, the unobserved determinants of happiness,\nU\nijt\n, are replaced with the term \u03b7\nj\n+\u03b7\nt\n+\u025b\nijt\n, where \u03b7\nj\nand \u03b7\nt\nare location\u2010fixed effects and time\u2010fixed effects, respectively. The location\u2010fixed\n               effects capture unobserved time\u2010invariant characteristics that are common to all people\n               in location\nj\n, whereas the time\u2010fixed effects capture unobserved location\u2010invariant circumstances\n               that are common to all people at date\nt\n. The term \u025b\nijt\nis the individual\u2010specific disturbance term which (in addition to measurement error)\n               captures unobserved characteristics of the individuals.\nMethodological issues \u2013 which may imply possible weaknesses of the happiness approach\n               \u2013 refer to the nature of the dependent variable as well as to the explanatory variables.\n3.2\nThe Nature of Happiness Data\nAn evident precondition for applying the happiness approach is that the subjective\n               well\u2010being data,\nW\nijt\n, satisfy appropriate quality requirements. In particular, basic conditions for using\n               happiness or life satisfaction data as empirical approximations to individual utility\n               are that they be at least ordinal in character and satisfy conventional quality standards.\n               Whether these conditions are being satisfied has been widely assessed in decades of\n               validation research (see, for example,\nFrey and Stutzer, 2002\n, for references). In these studies measures of subjective well\u2010being are generally\n               found to have a sufficient scientific standard in terms of internal consistency, validity,\n               reliability, and a high degree of stability over time (\nDiener\net al.\n, 1999\n). Different measures of subjective well\u2010being \u2013 especially measures of happiness\n               and of life satisfaction \u2013 correlate well with each other and, according to factor\n               analyses, represent a single unitary construct. Happiness responses are correlated\n               with physical reactions that can be thought of as describing true, internal happiness:\n               people reporting to be happy tend to smile more and show lower levels of stress responses\n               (heart rate, blood pressure), and they are less likely to commit suicide. Overall,\n               measures of reported subjective well\u2010being can be viewed as valid and reliable empirical\n               approximations to individual utility.\nIn addition to their validity and reliability properties, happiness data not only\n               need to be (at least) ordinal, but also need to be comparable in the sense that people\n               share a common opinion of what happiness is. This assumption relies on supporting\n               evidence from psychology (\nDiener\net al.\n, 1999\n). One indication is that individuals are able to recognize and predict the happiness\n               level of others. Happy people are usually rated by others as being happy. While comparability\n               is a stronger assumption than economists frequently need to make, it may be less problematic\n               at a practical than at a theoretical level (\nKahneman, 1999\n). As argued by\nNg (1997)\n, non\u2010comparability of utility is an overly restrictive assumption.\nA stronger assumption than comparability (people use discrete happiness ratings in\n               the same way) is cardinality (the distances between consecutive happiness ratings\n               are the same). Cardinality is not a necessary assumption for applying the happiness\n               approach: if comparability is assumed, this permits happiness functions to be estimated\n               as ordered discrete choice models, such as an ordered logit or probit. Even though\n               the estimated coefficients from these models refer to an unobserved, or latent, variable\n               and thus have no meaningful interpretation, the\nratio\nbetween any two coefficients can legitimately be employed to compute the marginal\n               rate of substitution between the associated variables. This applies especially to\n               the marginal rate of substitution of income for environmental quality. The assumption\n               of cardinality is unnecessary since the marginal rate of substitution is\nper se\nan ordinal concept. The same is true for the equivalent or compensating variations,\n               as monetary measures for non\u2010marginal welfare changes.\n3.3\nExplanatory Variables\nThe most important set of explanatory variables refers to\nenvironmental conditions\n,\nQ\njt\n. Environmental conditions may be described by various sorts of pollution, or by climate\n               parameters and the occurrence of natural hazards. If pollution is the item in question,\n               data on ambient pollution appear to be more appropriate than emission data since the\n               latter may mask the diffusion processes by which emissions are being spread before\n               they affect people's well\u2010being. The geographical as well as the temporal matching\n               of happiness and pollution are important aspects. Aggregating environmental conditions\n               across space or time may mask much of their heterogeneity, but may be necessary if\n               happiness data feature only a crude specification of place and time.\nIncome\n,\nM\nijt\n, is ideally a continuous variable. However, happiness surveys frequently offer only\n               discrete income bands to which the respondents are asked to assign themselves. It\n               is then common to use the midpoints of these intervals. A special problem in that\n               case relates to the open\u2010ended top interval, to which no numerical value can be assigned.\n               People in the top income interval then must be omitted, which may create a selection\n               bias. Income data usually refer to household income. This should be reflected in the\n               interpretation of valuation results. Alternatively, it is common to transform household\n               income into per capita income or equivalent income by correcting for the number of\n               household members.\nAs concerns the\ncontrol variables\n, the micro\u2010level characteristics,\nD\nijt\n, are usually contained in the survey data whereas the macro\u2010level correlates of happiness,\nX\njt\n, are taken from supplementary sources (for example, National Accounts). Together\n               with the location and time dummies (\u03b7\nj\n, \u03b7\nt\n), the control variables account for a portion of heterogeneity among survey respondents.\n               Any remaining unobserved heterogeneity is included in the disturbance term, \u025b\nijt\n.\n3.4\nEstimating Strategy\nIt was stated above that, given the nature of the happiness data, it is appropriate\n               to estimate\nequation (9)\nusing a discrete choice model (such as the ordered probit or logit). A disadvantage\n               to such a strategy, however, relates to the problem of unobserved heterogeneity. It\n               has been found that people's happiness is strongly related to usually unobserved personality\n               traits which, in turn, may influence some of their observed characteristics, such\n               as income (\nBertrand and Mullainathan, 2001\n;\nRavallion and Lokshin, 2001\n). This may imply simultaneity bias (richer people are happier\nand\nhappier people are richer). Provided the data have an individual\u2010panel structure,\n               this problem can be addressed by using individual\u2010specific fixed effects. However,\n               allowing for individual\u2010fixed effects in an ordered probit generates inconsistent\n               estimates (\nCameron and Trivedi, 1998\n). There have been two recent proposed econometric approaches that deal with this\n               in the context of economics and happiness: generalized threshold and sequential models\n               (\nBoes and Winkelmann, 2004\n), and the conditional fixed\u2010effect ordered logit (\nFerrer\u2010i\u2010Carbonell and Frijters, 2004\n). However, an important result of the latter paper is that, instead of these sophisticated\n               methods, it is rather innocuous to assume cardinality of the happiness data and estimate\n               the model (including individual\u2010fixed effects) using least squares.\n13\nThe authors of that study conclude that assuming cardinality is a less serious problem\n               than neglecting unobserved heterogeneity.\nThe described strategy of using individual\u2010fixed effects is applicable only when the\n               happiness data refer to the same set of people at different dates. This condition\n               is rarely fulfilled. In addition, individual panels may not remain representative\n               over time. However, if it is true that assuming cardinality does not create large\n               biases, one can address the problem of unobserved micro\u2010heterogeneity by means of\n               aggregation, i.e. by considering average happiness at place\nj\nand date\nt\n. If each set of respondents at place\nj\nand date\nt\nis a representative sample (for example, a\nEurobarometer Survey\nin country\nj\nand year\nt\n), micro\u2010level heterogeneity (observed and unobserved) drops from the estimating equation,\n               leading to the following macro\u2010level happiness regression:\n(10)\nwhere\nW\njt\nis average happiness (a continuous variable) at location\nj\nand time\nt\n, and\nM\njt\nand \u025b\nj\nt\nare average income and the corresponding disturbance term, respectively.\nIt may have become clear that the happiness approach \u2013 though based on a simple and\n               compelling general idea \u2013 involves a variety of methodological alternatives. The following\n               section will review applications of the happiness approach. The review will address\n               not just the type of environmental condition studied and the results obtained, but\n               also the methodological issues discussed above.\n4.\u2002A Review of Valuation Studies\nThough there is by now a considerable literature on the economics of happiness, applications\n            to non\u2010market valuation are still rare. The environmental issues studied so far include\n            air pollution, water pollution, noise, climate conditions and natural hazards; see\nTable 2\n.\n14\nTable 2.\nSynopsis of Valuation Studies.\nSubject\nAuthors\nDependent variable\nScale\nOrdinal or cardinal\nMicro or macro\nControl for heterogeneity\nEmissions or concentrations\nIncome variable\nEnvironmental change\nEffects captured\nAir pollution\nWelsch (2002)\nHappiness\n4\u2010point verbal\nCardinal\nMacro (cross\u2010section)\nMacro controls\n1\nConcentrations\nGNP per capita\nMarginal change\nDirect effects\nAir pollution\nWelsch (2006)\nLife satisfaction\n4\u2010point verbal\nCardinal\nMacro (panel)\nCountry and year dummies\n1\nConcentrations\nGNP per capita\nMarginal and non\u2010marginal\nDirect effects\nAir pollution\nWelsch (2007)\nHappiness\n4\u2010point verbal\nCardinal\nMacro (cross\u2010section)\nMacro controls\n1\nConcentrations\nGNP per capita\nMarginal and non\u2010marginal\nDirect and total (net) effects\nWater pollution\nIsrael and Levinson (2003)\n(a) Happiness(b) Life satis\u2010 faction\n(a) 4\u2010point verbal;(b) 10 pt. numerical\n(a) Ordinal(b) Cardinal\n(a, b) Micro (multi\u2010country)\n(a, b) Micro controls\n(a, b) Emissions\n(a, b) GDP per capita\n(a, b) Marginal\n(a, b) Direct effects\nNoise\nVan Praag and Baarsma (2005)\nQuality of life\n10\u2010point numerical\nOrdinal\nMicro\nMicro controls\nNot applicable\n2\nContinuous household income\nMarginal\nDirect and total effects\n3\nClimate\nFrijters and Van Praag (1998)\nLife satisfaction\n10\u2010point numerical\nOrdinal and cardinal\nMicro\nMicro controls region dummies\nNot applicable\n4\nContinuous household income\nMarginal\nDirect and total effects\n5\nClimate\nRehdanz and Maddison (2005)\nHappiness\n4\u2010point verbal\nCardinal\nMacro (panel)\nMacro controls\n1\nNot applicable\n4\nGDP per capita\nMarginal\nDirect effects\nDrought\nCarroll\net al.\n(2009)\nLife satisfaction\n11\u2010point numerical\nCardinal\nMicro\nMicro controls season dummies\nNot applicable\n6\nMidpoints from income bands\nMarginal\nDirect and total effects\nFlood\nLuechinger and Raschky (2007)\nLife satisfaction\n4\u2010point verbal\nCardinal\nMicro (multi\u2010 country)\nMicro controls country and year dummies\nNot applicable\n7\nMidpoints from income bands\n8\nNon\u2010marginal\nDirect effects\n1\nMicro heterogeneity expected to even out due to averaging.\n2\nNoise indicator and perceived noise nuisance.\n3\nHousing prices are controlled for but found unaffected by noise.\n4\nClimate parameters (temperature and precipitation).\n5\nWages are controlled for.\n6\nDummy variable for drought events.\n7\nDummy variable for flood events; flood exposure.\n8\nMidpoints from household income bands converted to equivalence income.\n4.1\nAir Pollution\nAn initial happiness\u2010related study of pollution has been provided by\nWelsch (2002)\n. The paper studies air pollution in a cross\u2010section of 54 countries. The well\u2010being\n               variable is \u2018happiness\u2019, measured on a four\u2010point verbal scale. The original happiness\n               data are taken to be cardinal, and average happiness by country is used as the dependent\n               variable. The paper thus follows the macro approach, the suggested rationale being\n               that unobserved within\u2010country heterogeneity should even out when aggregating across\n               individuals. Unobserved between\u2010country heterogeneity is controlled for by the share\n               of scientists and engineers in the population, a variable which serves as a proxy\n               for the prevalence of secular\u2010rational attitudes as opposed to traditional values.\n               Pollution variables are average levels of ambient sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide\n               and total suspended particles. The income variable is GNP per capita (at purchasing\n               power parities). Out of the pollution variables considered, only nitrogen dioxide\n               turns out to be significant. The paper finds the\nMV\nof a 1 kiloton reduction in urban nitrogen dioxide to be about $70. The valuation\n               is restricted to direct effects of marginal changes in pollution.\n15\nThat analysis is extended in\nWelsch (2007)\nto comprise total effects and non\u2010marginal changes in pollution. Using the same basic\n               data set and happiness function, the model is augmented by a concave production function\n               for per capita GNP. In the production function, nitrogen dioxide plays the role of\n               a quasi\u2010input, other inputs being physical and human capital per capita. In this set\u2010up,\n               the\nTMV\nof a change in pollution is actually a\nnet\nMV\n, i.e. the marginal product less the monetized marginal (happiness\u2010related) damage.\n               The net\nMV\nat observed pollution levels is found to be negative for most countries. By computing\n               that level of pollution at which the marginal product and the marginal damage are\n               equalized, optimal pollution reduction rates are determined. Finally, the\nTCV\ns (in terms of capital costs saved; see note\n6\n) from these reductions are computed.\nTo better approach the problem of unobserved between\u2010country heterogeneity,\nWelsch (2006)\nuses a combined cross\u2010section time\u2010series framework comprising annual data (1990\u20131997)\n               for 10 European countries. This kind of panel structure permits country fixed effects\n               to be used to control for unobserved between\u2010country heterogeneity. The cardinal\u2010macro\n               design is retained in this study, but the well\u2010being variable is now \u2018life satisfaction\u2019\n               (originally measured on a four\u2010point verbal scale). Pollution variables are ambient\n               levels of nitrogen dioxide, total suspended particles, and lead. The income variable\n               is GNP per capita. The happiness function is specified as a Cobb\u2013Douglas, allowing\n               for synergies among the pollutants. While total suspended particles (again) turn out\n               to be insignificant, nitrogen dioxide and lead are both significantly related to life\n               satisfaction. The reductions achieved with respect to the latter two pollutants in\n               many European countries in the period considered are valued in terms of equivalent\n               variations. They amount to about $750 per capita per year in the case of nitrogen\n               dioxide and about $1400 per capita per year in the case of lead. Due to synergies\n               among the pollutants, the value of simultaneously reducing nitrogen dioxide and lead\n               is slightly higher than the sum of these values. Since total suspended particles are\n               insignificant in the life satisfaction regression but correlated to the two other\n               pollutants, their valuation may be thought to be captured implicitly.\n4.2\nWater Pollution\nIsrael and Levinson (2003)\nhave used the happiness approach to value water pollution. Their analysis refers\n               to a cross\u2010section of 30 countries. They use both \u2018happiness\u2019 data (on a four\u2010point\n               verbal scale) and, alternatively, \u2018life satisfaction\u2019 data (measured on a 10\u2010point\n               numerical scale). While the \u2018happiness\u2019 data are treated as ordinal (implying the\n               use of a discrete choice model), the life satisfaction data are taken to be cardinal\n               (permitting the use of least squares). In both cases they pursue the micro approach,\n               i.e. they use the individual well\u2010being ratings rather than aggregated data. Accordingly,\n               they employ a set of socio\u2010demographic characteristics to accommodate the (observable)\n               heterogeneity of the respondents. As income variables they use categories of household\n               income as well as GDP per capita (linear and quadratic). The environmental variables\n               considered are emissions of organic water pollutants per capita per day.\n16\nThe MV of water pollution (derived from the coefficients on pollution and GDP per\n               capita of the life satisfaction regression, and computed at the median GDP) is $660\n               per gram per capita per day (where 1 gram is more than 10% of the mean pollution load).\n4.3\nNoise\nVan Praag and Baarsma (2005)\nhave used the happiness approach to value airport noise nuisance near Amsterdam's\n               Schiphol airport. Their well\u2010being variable is subjective \u2018quality of life\u2019, elicited\n               in a special survey administered in an area 50 kilometers around the airport and measured\n               on a 10\u2010point numerical scale. Since the data are treated as ordinal, a discrete choice\n               framework for the micro\u2010level data is adopted. The income variable is household income,\n               which is available as a continuous variable. The environmental variable of concern\n               is an indicator of noise, defined in terms of decibel levels, the number of flights,\n               and whether flights take place at daytime or nighttime. In addition, there is an indicator\n               of perceived noise nuisance (obtained from the survey). The approach adopted for valuation\n               is a two\u2010stage procedure, in which perceived noise nuisance acts as an explanatory\n               variable in a well\u2010being function, and perceived noise nuisance, in turn, is explained\n               by the objective noise indicator as well as by the time spent at home, and the presence\n               of a balcony or garden. The approach controls for the presence of noise insulation.\n               The authors find that a 50% increase in the noise indicator would require a compensating\n               increase in income by about 0.8% in the presence of insulation and 2.2% in the absence\n               of insulation. In addition, they find that housing prices are statistically unrelated\n               to the noise level, implying that the monetized well\u2010being effect captures most of\n               the noise\u2010related damage.\n4.4\nClimate\nA happiness\u2010based assessment of climate parameters was performed by\nFrijters and Van Praag (1998)\n. Their analysis is a cross\u2010section study referring to 35 \u2018climate regions\u2019 in Russia.\n               It uses life satisfaction on a 10\u2010point numerical scale as the well\u2010being variable.\n               The variable is alternatively treated as ordinal or cardinal, permitting experiments\n               with both ordered probit and least squares estimation. The estimations refer to micro\u2010level\n               well\u2010being and employ individual characteristics to control for observed micro heterogeneity\n               as well as some dummies (for example, for rural regions) to control for between\u2010region\n               heterogeneity. Income is defined as household income and measured as a continuous\n               variable. The estimations include up to six climate variables referring to various\n               seasons (temperature, wind speed, precipitation, humidity). One finding on the basis\n               of\nMV\ns is that an increase in average July temperature (by 1 degree Centigrade) decreases\n               well\u2010being by the same amount as a decrease of 16% in income would. However, a regression\n               of income on climate conditions shows that current incomes already compensate to a\n               considerable extent for unfavorable climates.\nA more recent study of climate and happiness is by\nRehdanz and Maddison (2005)\n. The design of that study is similar to\nWelsch (2002)\nin that they consider \u2018happiness\u2019 measured on a four\u2010point verbal scale, treat it\n               as a cardinal variable, and use average happiness by country as the dependent variable.\n               Using a panel of 67 countries (with 185 observations), they control for between\u2010country\n               heterogeneity by means of social and macroeconomic indicators (such as life expectancy,\n               literacy rate, religion, unemployment, inflation etc.). Their income variable is GDP\n               per capita, which is included in linear and quadratic form. The climate parameters\n               of concern are temperature and precipitation, for which both average and extreme values\n               are considered. The paper finds that happiness is significantly raised by higher minimum\n               temperatures and reduced by higher maximum temperatures as well as by an increased\n               frequency of dry conditions. Though the model is non\u2010linear, the authors apply the\nMV\ns that result from their estimates to value the (non\u2010marginal) changes in temperature\n               and precipitation expected to occur by 2039 and 2069 (increased frequencies of warm\n               and dry summers, reduced frequencies of cold winters). Utility\u2010constant compensations\n               for losers from climate change (low\u2010latitude countries) are up to $500 per capita\n               per year while, on the other hand, gainers (high\u2010latitude countries) benefit by up\n               to $600.\n4.5\nNatural Hazards\nAnother climate\u2010related study is concerned with the occurrence of drought conditions\n               in Australia (\nCarroll\net al.\n, 2009\n). The paper uses \u2018life satisfaction\u2019 on an 11\u2010point numerical scale as the well\u2010being\n               variable and treats it as a cardinal variable in a micro\u2010level happiness regression.\n               Income is measured by the midpoints from five household income bands. A condition\n               of \u2018drought\u2019 is taken to prevail if precipitation is below a given threshold and is\n               captured by a dummy variable. All relevant variables are quarterly data from 2001\n               to 2004. The spatial units for both the individual\u2010related data as well as the meteorological\n               data are 2435 postcode districts. The regressions control for the usual micro\u2010level\n               characteristics as well as for season. A basic regression, which includes income as\n               an exogenous explanatory variable, is used to determine\nMV\n. An additional regression that omits income is intended to capture\nTMV\n, i.e. the total monetized marginal well\u2010being effect including the impact of drought\n               on income.\n17\nUsing that estimate of the\nTMV\n, the paper finds a spring drought in a rural area equivalent to a loss in annual\n               household income of A$18,000 (about US$14,500). Since the estimate of\nMV\namounts to A$17,000, it is concluded that the actual income loss (due to a fall in\n               agricultural yields) amounts to just A$1000. It is thus suggested that the total effect\n               is dominated by psychological costs (due to uncertainty, idleness and frustration).\nAn important natural hazard impacting on subjective well\u2010being is the occurrence of\n               flood. The valuation of these impacts has been investigated by\nLuechinger and Raschky (2007)\nin a study involving 16 European countries, 1973\u20131998. The study uses micro\u2010level\n               \u2018life satisfaction\u2019 on a four\u2010point verbal scale and treats it as a cardinal variable.\n               The regression controls for micro\u2010level characteristics as well as for per capita\n               GDP and the unemployment rate in the respective countries. The income variable is\n               a measure of equivalence income, constructed by taking the midpoints of 12 classes\n               of household income and dividing by the square root of the household size. The occurrence\n               of a flood is captured by a dummy variable and matched to the life satisfaction data\n               on the basis of respondents' region of residence (the number of regions being about\n               200). Treating income as exogenous, the value of a flood event is measured by the\n               compensating variation and is found to be nearly $3000 per person per year (which\n               corresponds to 27% of average equivalence income).\n4.6\nA Synopsis\nThe studies reviewed above reveal that subjective well\u2010being is significantly linked\n               to income on the one hand and a variety of environmental variables on the other, and\n               that these relationships can be used to derive sensible estimates of the monetary\n               valuation of environmental conditions.\nThough the general valuation approach is the same in all of these studies, there are\n               considerable differences with respect to the methodological details. The synopsis\n               of methodological choices in\nTable 2\nreveals that there is not a single pair of studies which use exactly the same methodology.\n5.\u2002Conclusions\nRecent years have witnessed the emergence of a novel approach to environmental valuation,\n            the happiness approach. This methodology correlates measures of subjective well\u2010being\n            with people's incomes and measures of environmental conditions, and employs these\n            correlations to estimate the trade\u2010offs people are willing to make between money and\n            environmental quality. This paper has reviewed the conceptual and methodological issues\n            pertinent to the happiness approach, as well as applications to air and water pollution,\n            noise nuisance, climate parameters and natural hazards.\nThe happiness approach yields several advantages over standard techniques of valuation,\n            while having weaknesses of its own. It avoids the stringent assumptions concerning\n            the rationality of agents and the functioning of markets that are characteristic of\n            revealed preference methods, and the use of hypothetical scenarios which may entail\n            unreliable results and strategic behavior in the stated preference case.\nThe strength of the happiness approach is that it permits the capture and monetization\n            of virtually all effects that environmental conditions may have on individual well\u2010being,\n            be they direct (psychological) or indirect (through material and economic damage,\n            say), and \u2013 importantly \u2013 independent of whether affected individuals are consciously\n            aware of cause\u2013effect relationships or not.\nA major caveat refers to the circumstance that the happiness approach relies on interpersonal\n            comparability of subjective well\u2010being, an assumption economists usually do not need\n            to make (but which is tentatively supported by findings from psychological research).\n            Another area of concern relates to the possibility of biased estimates stemming from\n            unobserved heterogeneity among individuals (a problem that can be addressed by means\n            of appropriate statistical techniques).\nChallenges to be addressed when applying the happiness approach mainly relate to the\n            database. While the ordinal character of happiness data is not a genuine problem,\n            a difficulty arises from the fact that income data are frequently available only in\n            the form of income bands, not as a continuous variable. Another difficulty is that\n            the spatial and temporal matching between happiness and income on the one hand and\n            environmental conditions on the other is sometimes rather crude. In the light of this,\n            improvements in available data sets may be expected to enhance the precision of results.\nIn spite of these caveats, the applications reviewed in this paper suggest that the\n            happiness approach is capable of yielding meaningful results, and that it may be important\n            at least as a complement to and validation test of standard valuation tools.\nAcknowledgement\nWe are grateful to Udo Ebert and an anonymous referee for useful comments.\nNotes\n1\nMore recently, concern over environmental integrity and sustainability gained prominence\n               as a motivation for environmental regulation.\n2\nThough \u2018subjective well\u2010being\u2019 is the more encompassing concept, the terms happiness,\n               life satisfaction, experienced utility and subjective well\u2010being will be used interchangeably\n               unless stated otherwise.\n3\nBy including housing prices, the happiness and the hedonic pricing approach can be\n               combined (see\nSection 2.3\n).\n4\nOne way of obtaining the\nTMV\nis by estimating the reduced form\nW\n=\nF\n(\nQ\n,\nG\n(\nQ\n,\nZ\n)) =:\nH\n(\nQ\n,\nZ\n), which yields\nTMV\n= (\u2202\nH\n/\u2202\nQ\n)/(\u2202\nF\n/\u2202\nM\n), provided\nF\n(\nQ\n,\nM\n) is known.\n5\nTreating pollution as a quasi\u2010input is a frequently applied modelling strategy in\n               environmental economics, see for example\nCropper and Oates (1992)\n. A derivation involving the materials balance principle is provided by\nEbert and Welsch (2007)\n.\n6\nAs an alternative to\nTCV\nand\nTEV\n,\nWelsch (2007)\nhas proposed and applied utility\u2010constant changes in the costs to be expended on\n               inputs\nZ\n.\n7\nFor an extensive discussion of the standard approaches, see\nFreeman (2003)\n. For a comparison of the standard approaches and the happiness approach, see also\nFrey\net al.\n(2004)\n.\n8\nIn a recent review of 45 tests of the valuation disparity, the mean ratio of WTA values\n               over WTP values was found to be over 7 (\nHorowitz and McConnell, 2002\n).\n9\nAt a more general level, there are not only behavioral problems but also theoretical\n               objections to using contingent valuation as an element of cost\u2013benefit analysis, especially\n               because it relies on the theoretically discredited criterion of potential Pareto improvement\n               (\nGowdy, 2004\n).\n10\nWith respect to such effects,\nCropper (2000)\nasserts that it is unlikely that individuals are very well\u2010educated about the health\n               risks of dirty air. She notes that it is more likely that property values capture\n               all of the aesthetic benefits (for example, visibility), but only capture a portion\n               of the health effects.\nZabel and Kiel (2000)\nnote that it is still unclear how individuals process air quality information when\n               determining their willingness to pay for housing. Similar reasoning may apply to willingness\n               to pay for air quality elicited in contingent valuation studies.\n11\nWe are grateful to a reviewer for providing some of these examples.\n12\nThe linear income term may be augmented by squared income or be replaced by the log\n               of income in order to capture declining marginal utility of income.\n13\nIn particular, it is found with respect to the usual micro\u2010level correlates of happiness\n               (including income) that their sign as well as whether they are significant or not,\n               and the trade\u2010offs between them (marginal rates of substitution), are fairly invariant\n               to using least squares.\n14\nOutside the environmental realm, there are valuation studies of terrorism (\nFrey\net al.\n, 2004\n), civil war (\nWelsch, 2008a\n) and corruption (\nWelsch, 2008b\n).\n15\nFor illustrative purposes, the\nMV\nis applied to non\u2010marginal changes.\n16\nAverage levels of ambient air pollution (total suspended particles, nitrogen dioxide\n               and sulfur dioxide) are considered as well, but found insignificant.\n17\nUnlike the procedure discussed in the conceptual section above, the regression does\n               not control for other determinants of income.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

In the real world, many decisions on important life events are to accept or reject\n            an offered\nsingle option\nsuch as straightening of teeth, admission to college, counterfeit cash, a marriage\n            proposal, a home mortgage, early retirement, or signing away an inheritance.\nWhen deciding whether to take an option, quite often in real life, the offered option\n            will result in apparent loss such as the earlier mentioned \u201cunpaid overtime\u201d or \u201csigning\n            away an inheritance\u201d. In such a case, to reject an option resulting in loss is exactly\n            what the \u201cLaw of Survival\u201d wants us to do. The \u201cshould\u2010do\u201d behavior has been well\n            documented in both Chinese and Western literature. For instance, Kuan\u2010tzu said \u201cno\n            one can resist advantages or will embrace disadvantage voluntarily (Kuan\u2010tzu, 740\u2010645\n            BC, p.1074\u20131075).\u201d In\nThe Wealth of Nations\n, published in 1776, Adam Smith famously argued that economic behavior was motivated\n            by self\u2010interest (Ashraf, Camerer, & Loewenstein,\n2005\n).\nIn fact, however, we did choose to accept an offered loss ourselves in daily activities.\n            That is, we accepted an offer of \u201cunpaid overtime,\u201d \u201cinnocent being used,\u201d or \u201cbeing\n            falsely accused and condemned\u201d from time to time. Does the choice of an offered loss\n            represent a decision bias or a deliberate decision? Due to a lack of a pertinent model\n            or theory available to explain the mechanisms producing decision outcomes, little\n            is known about why we choose to take an option that results in loss.\nHowever, a long\u2010lasting Chinese dogma, \u201c\u5403\u4e8f\u662f\u798f\u201d (suffering a loss is good fortune),\n            a phrase attributed to the multitalented poet\u2010calligrapher Zheng Banqiao (Hammond,\n2007\n), seems to depict, explain, and value such action of taking an option that results\n            in loss. Even today, the old dogma is still heard. For example, we can easily find\n            several books on the market entitled\nSuffering a Loss is Good Fortune\n(J.H. Liu,\n2011\n; Zhao,\n2008\n). There is a family drama TV series entitled\nSuffering a Loss is Good Fortune\n, directed by He Qun, and an American comedy\u2010drama film\nSomeday This Pain Will Be Useful to You\n, directed by Roberto Faenza and based on Peter Cameron's novel of the same name,\n            it is translated into Chinese as \u201c\u5403\u4e8f\u662f\u798f\u201d (Chikui shi fu).\nInterestingly, not only the media are enthusiastic advocates of telling the story\n            of \u201csuffering a loss is good fortune;\u201d people from all walks of life are willing to\n            believe in this story. Our preliminary investigation found that members of young generations\n            or older generations tended to agree with the dogma \u201csuffering a loss is good fortune.\u201d\nThe next question we might ask is why the old belief can be passed on from generation\n            to generation. In particular, why is \u201cChikui\u201d a choice people want to make? Could\n            it be real gold or fool's gold?\nIn classical decision theory, options are presented as points in a multidimensional\n            space, in which each dimension represents a distinct attribute that describes the\n            object (M\u00e9ndez,\n1974\n; Birnbaum,\n1997\n; see also Sun, Li, Bonini, & Su,\n2012\n). As such, a single option that results in loss can also be presented as a unique\n            point in a multidimensional space. With this in mind, it would be easier for us to\n            understand why we should or why we should not choose the \u201cChikui\u201d option.\nTo put it normatively, when options are represented by a fixed set of dimensions,\n            choices are assumed to be guided by the principle of value maximization (Luce,\n1959\n). Each option\nx\ni\nis assigned a value\nv\n(\nx\ni\n), such that the decision maker selects the option with the highest value in the face\n            of a given set of dimensions (Tversky & Shafir,\n1992\n).\nIf we define \u201cChikui\u201d (suffering a loss) as choice behaviors that result in an apparent\n            loss in terms of money, goods, time, health, opportunity, relationship, and even\nmianzi\n(face), then, all these could serve as offered dimensions on which an offered loss\n            is represented. That is, a single option (Option\ny\ni\n) that results in loss can be presented as a unique point by the decision maker in\n            a one\u2010dimensional or in multidimensional space. This will render the understanding\n            of the single option choice much simpler: all we need to do is to accept the option\n            that results in gain (Option\nx\ni\n) and reject the option that results in loss (Option\ny\ni\n) (see Figure\n1\na).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nOption\u2010representing framework for explaining Chikui choice.

If Option\nx\ni\nor Option\ny\ni\nis a single offered option that needs to be accepted or not, then Option\nx\ni\nshould be accepted while Option\ny\ni\nshould be rejected because\nv\n(\nx\ni\n) is always positive while\nv\n(\ny\ni\n) is always negative. If Option\nx\ni\nand Option\ny\ni\nconstitute a pair of offered options from which to choose, then, according to the\n                     principle of value maximization (Luce,\n1959\n), Option\nx\ni\nshould be selected because\nv\n(\nx\ni\n)\u00a0>\nv\n(\ny\ni\n).

If Option xi and Option yi\n                        constitute a pair of offered options from which to choose, then, according to the\n                        principle of value maximization (Luce, ), Option xi should be selected because v(xi)\u00a0>\u00a0v(yi).\n                        (b) Di\u00a0=\u00a0offered money, goods, time, health, opportunity, relationship, or mianzi\n                        dimension; Dj\u00a0=\u00a0any extra dimension that is not offered but self\u2010generated. If Option\n                        xij or Option yij is a single offered option that needs to be accepted or not, then\n                        Option xij should not always be accepted while Option yij should not always be rejected,\n                        because v(xij) is NOT always positive while v(yij) is NOT always negative [Colour\n                        figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]\nIt is obvious that to reject Option\nx\ni\nor to accept Option\ny\ni\nis illogical according to economic rationality models (Delton, Krasnow, Tooby, &\n            Cosmides,\n2011\n) and cannot be understood and communicated from the viewpoint of value maximization\n            (Luce,\n1959\n). Moreover, \u201cChikui\u201d (taking Option\ny\ni\n) seems to contradict the conventional view of\nloss aversion\n, which is commonly interpreted as the (marginal) disutility of a given loss being\n            larger than the (marginal) utility of the same amount of gain (Kahneman & Tversky,\n1979\n). Considering that the existing decision theory sees \u201cmaximizing gains\u201d or \u201cminimizing\n            losses\u201d as its basic principle, those theories will not predict or explain \u201cChikui\u201d\n            (suffer a loss) as a choice we want to make. As thus, conventional decision theory\n            does not account for a \u201cChikui\u201d choice above and beyond the law of the jungle, which\n            is \u201cachieving rewards and avoiding punishments.\u201d In other words, the incremental contribution\n            that conventional decision theory makes to explain why the offered loss is frequently\n            selected by ordinary people is limited.\nIt is worth noting, however, that if there exists any extra dimension, D\nj\n, that is not passively offered by the proposer but is actively and creatively produced\n            by the decision maker to present the offered option per se, then making a loss choice\n            (suffer a loss) can be easily understood and communicated. Namely, with the extra\n            dimension being generated and a delayed value (utility) being assigned to the generated\n            dimension,\nv\n(\nx\nij\n) is NOT always positive while\nv\n(\ny\nij\n) is NOT always negative. The value of an offered loss (\nv\n(\ny\nij\n)) can turn out to be positive if the value (utility) assigned to the option on the\n            newly generated dimension (D\nj\n) is greater than that assigned to the option on the offered dimension (D\ni\n) (Figure\n1\nb).\nTo say that \u201cactively generating an extra dimension and then assigning a delayed value\n            (utility) to the self\u2010generated dimension D\nj\n\u201d means that \u201cpeople subjectively believe they will gain later good fortune rewarded\n            by an unpredictable life situation\u201d (i.e., a person believes that such a\nsubjective\nlater good fortune might exist). To test our conjecture, it is essential for us to\n            find and present evidence that after suffering a loss, there does exist such a later\n            good fortune (gain) rewarded by an unpredictable life situation (self\u2010generated dimension\n            D\nj\n) (i.e., such an\nobjective\nlater good fortune (gain) does exist).\nIf such an\nobjective\nlater good fortune (gain) does exist, then it can be taken as empirical evidence\n            that there must be some self\u2010generated dimension on which the good fortune (gain)\n            was assigned to the option. Otherwise, taking an option that results in loss appears\n            to be completely unreasonable or not logical. The study reported in this paper therefore\n            intended to collect empirical evidence regarding the relationship between \u201csuffering\n            a loss\u201d and \u201cgood fortune.\u201d The study is organized as follows.\nIn Study 1, we searched for \u201cChikui\u201d\u2010related anecdotes told by worldwide celebrities,\n            and we then used these anecdotes as critical incidents of successful persons or winners\n            to develop an anecdote\u2010based scale to measure \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood. That is, we aimed\n            to develop a reliable and valid Chikui Likelihood Scale (CLS) that has shown criterion\u2010related,\n            empirical, convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity. In Study 2, we investigated\n            whether there is a linear correlation between \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood and real benefits\n            in a real\u2010world setting using the newly developed CLS. In Study 3, we investigated\n            the possibility that \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood has a reverse\u2010predictive effect on later\n            material or mental benefits. That is, we examined whether retrospective \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood\n            can predict a person's long\u2010term material or mental benefit.\nStudy 1: Developing an Anecdote\u2010based Scale to Measure \u201cChikui\u201d Likelihood\nPart 1\nStudy 1 involved two parts. The first involved a development of the CLS and provided\n               initial reliability and validity data. The second focused on providing further evidence\n               on validity of the CLS.\nMethod\nIdentification of \u201cChikui\u201d\u2010related anecdotes\nIf \u201cgood fortune\u201d is seen as a way of being \u201csuccessful in life,\u201d the dogma that \u201csuffering\n                  a loss is good fortune\u201d would suggest that \u201csuffering a loss\u201d (Chikui) is very likely\n                  to be what people need to do to be \u201csuccessful\u201d and can be identified and defined\n                  in behavioral terms.\nAccordingly, we searched for Chinese and foreign anecdotes of celebrities (successful\n                  people) in history, culture, literature, politics, science, and business.\nTen psychology graduate students taking a decision\u2010making course independently read\n                  through anthologies of celebrity anecdotes and identified those \u201cbehaviors selected\n                  by someone that result in an apparent loss of money, goods, time, health, opportunity,\n                  relationship, and even\nmianzi\n(face).\u201d Hundreds of anecdotes were considered. Although the final selection of \u201cChikui\u201d\u2010related\n                  anecdotes may not be exhaustive, it can be considered fairly representative.\nDisagreements in raters' selections were resolved by discussion. The same individuals\n                  then independently rated each selected anecdote on two dimensions: item clarity and\n                  response appropriateness. Raters were blind to the purpose and predictions of the\n                  study.\nThe following numbers of anecdotes were classified as \u201cChikui\u201d\u2010related: three of the\n                  approximately 24 anecdotes in\nTwenty\u2010Four Filial Deeds\n(Chen & Smith,\n2010\n), five of the approximately 66 anecdotes in\nLi Ka\u2010shing's Complete Biography\n(Sun,\n2010\n), 29 of the approximately 200 anecdotes in\nStories of World Famous Celebrities\n(Cui,\n2010\n), two of the approximately 19 anecdotes in\nFirst Families\n(Y.Z. Liu,\n2011\n), and 15 of the approximately 141 anecdotes in\nAnecdotes of Celebrity\n(Ma,\n2000\n). Example anecdotes included those related by Li Ka\u2010shing, Wang Lo Kat, the Rockefeller\n                  Family, Loo\u2010Keng Hua, and Mahatma Gandhi in India.\nGeneration and selection of \u201cChikui\u201d\u2010related scenarios\nA total of 54 anecdotes were identified as being related to \u201cChikui.\u201d We then rephrased\n                  each anecdote into a brief scenario with two options (Option A: the person described\n                  in the scenario chooses \u201cChikui;\u201d Option B: the person described in the scenario does\n                  NOT choose \u201cChikui\u201d) for respondents. Fifteen graduate students studying psychology\n                  were then asked to choose from the two options for each scenario. According to a binomial\n                  distribution, if more than 10 of the 15 evaluators selected Option A, the scenario\n                  was retained as satisfying the relevant criteria. Otherwise, the scenario was eliminated\n                  from consideration (Siegel,\n1956\n).\nAccordingly, 27 scenarios were eliminated. Another three scenarios were also eliminated\n                  because a group of four scenarios told a similar story.\nAs a result, a total of 24 scenarios (\n) were generated by rewriting the anecdotes of celebrities to serve as the items of\n                  the CLS. Following the logic of \u201cwalking in another person's shoes,\u201d we instructed\n                  the respondents to respond to each scenario as follows:\nPlease carefully read the following scenarios and\n,\nbased on your personal experiences\n,\nenter values between 0% and 100% to indicate the likelihood that you would act in\n                     the same way that is described\n. A greater value indicates greater likelihood that the respondent chooses \u201cChikui.\u201d\n                  The following is an example drawn from the 24 scenarios:\nZhang went to a store to purchase some goods. After Zhang paid for the goods and went\n                        home, a representative from the store called and told Zhang that one of the 100\u2010yuan\n                        bills was a counterfeit note, but the person was unsure whether the bill came from\n                        Zhang. Nevertheless, Zhang returned to the store and exchanged the money.\nImagine that you were Zhang in this situation. What is the likelihood that you would\n                  do the same thing? (      ) 0%________100%\nParticipants and procedure\nTo develop the CLS using a geographically convenient sample, a total of 671 (433 female,\n                  65.80%) adult passengers departing from Ji'nan West Railway Station were interviewed\n                  in the waiting lounge between 2013 and 2014. These passengers came from all walks\n                  of life (approximately 60 occupations) and from 19 different provinces in China, and\n                  ranged from 18 to 74\u00a0years of age (\nM\n=\u00a031.30,\nSD\n=\u00a09.48). Each participant completed the scales independently and was given a small\n                  gift (worth approximately 15 RMB yuan) for his/her participation.\nThe 671 participants were randomly divided into two groups by\nspss\nstatistical software. Exploratory factor analysis was performed on 335 participants,\n                  and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed on the other 336 participants.\n                  Differences between the two groups in age (\nt\n=\u00a00.24,\np\n>\u00a00.05), gender (\u03c7\n2\n=\u00a01.03,\np\n>\u00a00.05), years of education (\nt\n=\u00a01.01,\np\n>\u00a00.05), and monthly income (\nt\n=\u00a01.69,\np\n>\u00a00.05) were insignificant. All 671 participants were subjected to an analysis of\n                  internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of the CLS.\nA sample of 92 undergraduates (58 females, 63.04%) who participated in a test\u2013retest\n                  reliability study was recruited from the School of Psychology in Shandong Normal University.\n                  They participated for monetary compensation (\u00a55).\nTwo\u2010hundred undergraduate students (78 women, 122 men) who participated in a validation\n                  study (criterion\u2010related and empirical validity) were recruited from the School of\n                  Life Science in Shandong Normal University. They participated for monetary compensation\n                  (\u00a55).\nAll items were coded and scored, and all data were entered, checked for missing values,\n                  and analyzed using the statistical programs\nspss\nversion 13.0 and Amos version 7.0.\nResults and discussion\nItem discrimination\nIn the assessment of item discrimination, the discrimination index (D) was computed\n                  by subtracting the mean score of participants in the lower group (27%) from the mean\n                  value of those in the upper group (27%) and dividing it by the maximum possible discrimination.\n                  A value of 0.19 or below indicated that the item was subject to improvement (Hopkins,\n1998\n). Items with D\u00a0<\u00a00.19 included items 3, 4, 8, 13, 14, and 15. These six items were\n                  eliminated from the scale, thereby reducing the number of items from 24 to 18.\nFactor structure\nExploratory factor analysis\nThe Kaiser\u2010Meyer\u2010Olkin measure of sampling adequacy and the Bartlett Test of Sphericity\n                     were conducted on the data before factor extraction to ensure that the characteristics\n                     of the data set were suitable for factor analysis. The analysis yielded an index of\n                     0.84 in concert with a highly significant Bartlett Test of Sphericity (\u03c7\n2\n=\u00a01039.00,\ndf\n=\u00a0153,\np\n<\u00a00.001). To determine the number of factors underlying \u201cChikui,\u201d a principal component\n                     analysis using oblique factor rotation (promax) was conducted on the 18 items of the\n                     CLS.\nThe retention of factors was determined by several criteria. First, the Kaiser (\n1961\n) criterion of eigenvalues greater than 1 indicated a four\u2010factor solution. Second,\n                     scree plot analysis (Cattell,\n1966\n) suggested a three\u2010factor solution. Third, we ran the parallel analysis procedures\n                     (Horn,\n1965\n), which Zwick and Velicer (\n1986\n) found outperforms other methods such as the Kaiser criterion and scree plot, and\n                     identified a three\u2010factor solution.\nInspection of the Kaiser's rule, the scree plot analysis, and the Horn's parallel\n                     analysis showed that three factors underlie the 18 items of the CLS. The following\n                     criteria were used to determine whether an item loaded on its underlying factor: (i)\n                     the item had to have a factor loading of 0.40 or better on one factor and (ii) the\n                     cross\u2010loading differential across the two factors had to be less than 0.20. Items\n                     5, 6, 18, 20, 21, and 22 were eliminated because of the criteria mentioned earlier.\n                     Finally, principal components analysis with oblique rotation was conducted with the\n                     remaining items, resulting in a three\u2010factor solution that explained 46.47% of the\n                     variance.\nThe model's factor structure is shown in Table\n1\n. The first factor included five items (Chikui for conscience) that explained 27.56%\n                     of the variance, the second factor included four items (Chikui for wealth) that explained\n                     10.49% of the variance, and the third factor included three items (Chikui for reputation)\n                     that explained 8.42% of the variance.\nTable 1.\nFactor loadings of the 12 items of the Chikui Likelihood Scale\nItems\nFactor 1\nFactor 2\nFactor 3\nChikui for conscience\nItem 23\n0.72\n0.11\n0.18\nItem 24\n0.68\n0.10\n0.12\nItem 7\n0.64\n\u22120.08\n0.16\nItem 9\n0.56\n0.17\n0.07\nItem 16\n0.52\n0.23\n0.04\nChikui for wealth\nItem 11\n\u22120.00\n0.68\n0.28\nItem 19\n0.14\n0.67\n\u22120.18\nItem 17\n0.38\n0.54\n\u22120.05\nItem 12\n0.09\n0.52\n0.39\nChikui for reputation\nItem 2\n0.25\n\u22120.07\n0.63\nItem 1\n\u22120.01\n0.06\n0.63\nItem 10\n0.27\n0.15\n0.62\nNote\n: Loadings greater than or equal to 0.40 are shown in bold.\nConfirmatory factor analysis\nTo confirm the factor structure found in exploratory factor analysis, we performed\n                     a CFA on the 12 items of the CLS to determine whether a three\u2010factor solution best\n                     fit the data compared with alternative models of one\u2010factor solutions. The maximum\n                     likelihood estimation procedure was chosen to assess the measurement model in this\n                     study. However, maximum likelihood estimation is known to produce distorted results\n                     when the normality assumption is violated (Curran, West, & Finch,\n1996\n). Multivariate normality was assessed using the Mardia measure of multivariate kurtosis\n                     (Mardia,\n1970\n). The Mardia's coefficient for the data in this study was 31.55, which is lower than\n                     the value of 168 computed based on the formula\np\n(\np\n+\u00a02) where\np\nequals the number of observed variables in the model (Raykov & Marcoulides,\n2008\n). On this basis, multivariate normality of the data in this study was assumed.\nIn the CFA, the scale of the latent factor was set by fixing the variance of the latent\n                     factor equal to one. The hypothesized and alternative models were nested so that the\n                     model fit could be compared between models using chi\u2010square difference tests. Moreover,\n                     as presented in Table\n2\n, several indexes were used to determine the goodness of fit. The comparative fit\n                     index may range from 0 to 1, and values equal to or greater than 0.90 indicate a good\n                     fit to the data (Bentler & Bonnett,\n1980\n; Kline,\n1998\n). Similarly, scores 0.95 or above are desired with the Tucker\u2013Lewis Index (close\n                     fit\u00a0=\u00a00.95\u20130.99, acceptable fit\u00a0=\u00a00.90\u20130.95, Bentler & Bonnett,\n1980\n), the goodness of fit index, and the incremental fit index. Finally, a value of 0.08\n                     or less for the root mean square error approximation reflects a model with an adequate\n                     fit to the data, whereas values greater than 0.10 strongly suggest that the model\n                     fit is unsatisfactory (Browne & Cudeck,\n1989\n,\n1992\n).\nTable 2.\nAlternative models and significance test\nModel\n\u03c7\n2\ndf\n\u03c7\n2\n/\ndf\n\u0394\u03c7\n2\n\u0394\ndf\nGFI\nCFI\nIFI\nRMSEA\n1: One\u2010factor\n109.17\n71\n1.54\n0.93\n0.95\n0.95\n0.05\n2: Three\u2010factor\n67.76\n51\n1.27\n41.41\n20\n0.95\n0.97\n0.97\n0.04\nNote\n: Analysis is based on\nN\n=\u00a0336. Model 1 has one factor (Chikui). Model 2 has three factors (Chikui for conscience,\n                              Chikui for wealth, and Chikui for reputation). GFI, goodness of fit index; CFI, comparartive\n                              fit index; IFI, incremental fit index; RMSEA, root mean square error approximation.\nThe measures of fit for the different models are shown in Table\n2\n. Model 2 (three\u2010factor) provided a better fit to the data than did Model 1 (one\u2010factor)\n                     (\u0394\u03c7\n2\n=\u00a041.41; \u0394\ndf\n=\u00a020,\np\n<\u00a00.01). The correlations among three factors were significant, ranging from 0.25\n                     to 0.40 (\nps\n<\u00a00.01).\nReliability\nCronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated to estimate the reliability of the CLS.\n                  The internal consistencies were acceptable; Cronbach's alpha for the full scale was\n                  0.79, and the alphas for the subscales ranged from 0.61 to 0.73.\nAfter 1\u00a0month, we retested this scale with a sample of 92 undergraduates (58 women,\n                  63.04%), and the retest coefficients of the three subscales were 0.83 (Chikui for\n                  conscience), 0.70 (Chikui for wealth), and 0.64 (Chikui for reputation). The retest\n                  coefficient of the total scale was 0.86. According to Hair, Babin, Money, and Samouel\n                  (\n2003\n), the reliability of the scale is acceptable.\nValidity\nCriterion\u2010related validity\nConsidering that the conceptual similarity between the present CLS and the \u201cworth\u2010based\n                     choices\u201d scale developed by Tang, Zhou, Zhao, and Li (\n2014\n) is, to our best knowledge, the closest, we decided to select the \u201cworth\u2010based choices\u201d\n                     scale as related criterion and to examine the criterion\u2010related validity of the CLS\n                     by assessing its relationship with the \u201cworth\u2010based choices\u201d scale.\nTang et al.'s (\n2014\n) scale is an 18\u2010item measure of \u201cworth\u2010based choices.\u201d There are four factors underlying\n                     these \u201cworth\u2010based choices\u201d: \u60e0 (favor), \u5584 (virtue), \u4e49 (righteousness), and \u6cd5 (law).\n                     The following two sample items are from this scale:\nIf you have three apples, which option would you prefer? (A: eat all three apples\n                           by yourself, B: share two apples with a colleague or classmate)\nSuppose there are two internships for you to choose from: one is a small private enterprise\n                           with a monthly salary of 3000 yuan; the other is a large foreign\u2010funded enterprise\n                           with a monthly salary of 2000 yuan. Which option would you prefer? (A: private enterprise,\n                           B: foreign\u2010funded enterprise)\nIt is apparent that the items in Tang et al.'s (\n2014\n) scale are a choice between a pair of offered options, while the item in the CLS\n                     is a single option to accept or not. In addition, the items in the CLS are borrowed\n                     from anecdotes of real\u2010world celebrities who are successful later, whereas items in\n                     Tang et al. (\n2014\n) are not.\nThe correlations between Tang et al.'s scale (\n2014\n), the CLS, and their subscales are presented in Table\n3\n. Overall, we found a moderate correlation between Tang et al.'s scale (\n2014\n) and the CLS and their subscales. However, the law subscale of Tang et al.'s scale\n                     (\n2014\n) showed no significant correlation with the CLS and its subscales. The Chikui for\n                     the wealth subscale of the CLS did not correlate with the virtue and the righteousness\n                     subscales of Tang et al.'s scale (\n2014\n).\nTable 3.\nCorrelations between the Chikui Likelihood Scale, Tang et al.'s (\n2014\n) scale and their subscales (\nN\n=\u00a0200)\nTang et al.'s (\n2014\n) scale\nTotal scores\nFavor (\u60e0)\nVirtue (\u5584)\nRighteousness (\u4e49)\nLaw (\u6cd5)\nChikui Likelihood Scales\nTotal scores\n0.44\n***\n0.36\n***\n0.24\n***\n0.26\n***\n0.08\nChikui for conscience\n0.43\n***\n0.25\n***\n0.25\n***\n0.29\n***\n0.08\nChikui for wealth\n0.23\n**\n0.30\n***\n\u22120.01\n0.12\n0.06\nChikui for reputation\n0.22\n***\n0.22\n***\n0.28\n***\n0.13\n*\n0.03\n*\np\n<\u00a00.05.\n**\np\n<\u00a00.01.\n***\np\u00a0<\n0.001.\nEmpirical and incremental validity\nOur hypothesis regarding the empirical validity was that the \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood scores\n                     would be greater for those who chose \u201cChikui\u201d than those who did not. Considering\n                     that volunteers sacrifice their time and energy for the benefit of their communities,\n                     Tang et al. (\n2014\n) selected three types of volunteers (teaching in a remote area, serving at summer\n                     universiade, and donating blood without compensation) as people who chose \u201cChikui.\u201d\n                     Their results revealed that volunteers' scores (\nM\nteaching in a remote area\n=\u00a078.03,\nM\nserving at summer universiade\n=\u00a074.68,\nM\ndonating blood without compensation\n=\u00a070.89) of \u201cworth\u2010based choices\u201d were significantly higher than those of non\u2010volunteers\n                     (\nM\nnot teaching in a remote area\n=\u00a071.58,\nM\nnot serving at summer universiade\n=\u00a072.99,\nM\nnot donating blood without compensation\n=\u00a067.96) (\nps\n<\u00a00.05). In the present study, we followed this logic and selected volunteers as\n                     people who chose \u201cChikui\u201d to examine the empirical validity of the CLS. Moreover,\n                     considering that the correlations between Tang et al.'s scale (\n2014\n) and the CLS are moderate and that the \u201cworth\u2010based choices\u201d scale may serve as the\n                     most meaningful competitor for the CLS, we examined whether it is possible for the\n                     CLS to predict the outcome of volunteers after controlling for the scores of the \u201cworth\u2010based\n                     choices\u201d scale.\nThe result of the\nt\n\u2010test showed that volunteers had higher CLS scores (\nM\nvolunteers\n=\u00a0718.27) than non\u2010volunteers (\nM\nnon\u2010volunteers\n=\u00a0670.70) (\nt\n(198)\u00a0=\u00a02.21,\np\n<\u00a00.05). This result provided evidence in support of our hypothesis regarding the\n                     empirical validity. A binomial logistic regression analysis was then conducted with\n                     volunteers as the dependent variable, scores of the CLS as the independent variable,\n                     and participants' age, gender, and the scores of the worth\u2010based choice scale as the\n                     controlling variables. After controlling the variables mentioned earlier, CLS scores\n                     were significant incremental predictors of volunteers (Exp(\u03b2)\u00a0=\u00a01.002, Wald statistic\u00a0=\u00a04.236,\np\u00a0<\n0.05) (Table\n4\n).

Nevertheless,\n               these kinds of behaviors that look like \u201cChikui\u201d behavior have been studied extensively\n               and accounted for by certain personality traits (e.g., neuroticism or conscientiousness),\n               sociopolitical attitudes, altruism, delayed gratification, and so forth. If the CLS\n               measures meaningful constructs, then it should demonstrate convergent, discriminant,\n               and incremental validity by a predictable pattern of relationships with other relevant\n               variables within the \u201cnomological network\u201d (Cronbach & Meehl,\n1955\n). Our hypotheses about the relationship between the CLS and relevant variables were\n               as follows:\nConvergent validity\nWe assumed that CLS scores would moderately correlate with the following variables:\n                     altruism (dictator game, DG), certain personality traits (e.g., neuroticism and conscientiousness),\n                     grit, delayed gratification, and social and political attitudes.\nDiscriminant validity\nWe expected that CLS scores would not correlate with participants' gender or academic\n                     performance.\nCriterion\u2010related validity\nTo assess the relationship between the CLS and decision behaviors (rather than existing\n                     scales), we measured the behavioral decision outcomes to further examine the criterion\u2010related\n                     validity of the CLS. We expected that CLS scores would correlate with participants'\n                     choice behaviors in the ultimatum game (UG), DG, and intertemporal choice.\nIncremental validity\nIt was important to provide evidence that the CLS displayed incremental validity over\n                     an established instrument that might explain \u201cChikui\u201d behavior. That is, the CLS should\n                     capture unique variance in \u201cChikui\u201d behavior that was not accounted for by relevant\n                     instruments when predicting real \u201cChikui\u201d behavior. We expected that CLS scores would\n                     be a significant incremental predictor of volunteers and participants' willingness\n                     to have more than one child, after controlling the relevant variables within the \u201cnomological\n                     network.\u201d\nMethod\nParticipants\nHere, 296 undergraduate students (148 women, 148 men) were recruited from Shandong\n                  Normal University. The mean age of the participants was 19.41\u00a0years (\nSD\n=\u00a00.75). Participants completed all measures individually and received a gift valued\n                  at \u00a515 for their participation.\nMaterials and procedure\nParticipants completed the neuroticism and conscientiousness subscales (containing\n                  17 items) drawn from the Chinese version of the Big Five Inventory\u201044 (John, Donahue,\n                  & Kentle,\n1991\n; John, Naumann, & Soto,\n2008\n). Altruism was assessed with the DG, and the threshold for unfairness was measured\n                  by the UG (Forsythe, Horowitz, Savin, & Sefton,\n1994\n; Thielmann & Hilbig,\n2017\n). The mean UG scores were calculated using willingness circled on a 6\u2010point scale,\n                  and dictator allocations of 100 yuan made by participants in DG were coded. Grit was\n                  assessed with the Chinese version of the Grit Scale, containing 12 items rated on\n                  a 5\u2010point scale from 1 (not at all like me) to 5 (very much like me) (Duckworth, Peterson,\n                  Matthews, & Kelly,\n2007\n). Delayed gratification was assessed with the Chinese version of the Academic Delay\n                  of Gratification Scale (ADOGS) containing 10 items rated on a 4\u2010point scale (Bembenutty\n                  & Karabenick,\n1998\n). The Chinese version of the Social Dominance Orientation Scale (SDO) measured social\n                  and political attitudes using a 14\u2010item scale (Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle,\n1994\n). Mean scores were calculated from responses to a 7\u2010point Likert scale. In addition,\n                  fixed\u2010sequence choice titration was measured, and the degree of discounting was calculated\n                  by application of the hyperbolic equation (Hardisty & Weber,\n2009\n; Mazur,\n1987\n). As in\nPart 1\nof this study, the CLS was measured, and participants then answered questions about\n                  whether they were volunteers and their willingness to have more than one child. Participants\n                  also reported their gender, age, and academic performance (e.g., GPA) in the latest\n                  tests.\nResults and discussion\nConvergent validity\nThe correlations of the CLS and other scales we measured are reported in Table\n5\n. The CLS and its three subscales showed moderate positive correlations with the Grit\n                  Scale and conscientiousness on the BFI, with the correlation coefficients ranging\n                  from 0.12 to 0.21 (\np\ns\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This suggested that participants who scored higher on the CLS and its subscales\n                  were more perseverant and conscientious. Furthermore, the CLS scale and its subscales\n                  were moderately negatively correlated with the SDO, with the correlation coefficients\n                  ranging from \u22120.19 to \u22120.26 (\nps\n<\u00a00.05). The \u201cChikui for reputation\u201d subscale of the CLS showed negative correlations\n                  with the ADOGS. This indicated that participants scoring higher on the CLS were not\n                  likely to be discriminatory, and those who scored higher on the \u201cChikui for reputation\u201d\n                  subscale tended not to delay gratification. However, CLS scores were not correlated\n                  with allocating more money to the recipient in the DG. This suggested that the CLS\n                  and altruism may be two distinct constructs.\nTable 5.\nCorrelations between the CLS and measures of related constructs (\nN\n=\u00a0297)\nMeasure (\nN\n)\nM\n/\nSD\nAlpha\nCLS\nChikui for conscience\nChikui for wealth\nChikui for reputation\nNeuroticism on the BFI\n26.20/2.84\n0.81\n0.02\n0.04\n0.03\n\u22120.03\nConscientiousness on the BFI\n31.67/2.95\n0.79\n0.15\n*\n0.18\n**\n0.12\n*\n0.01\nGrit Scale\n37.68/5.95\n0.75\n0.19\n**\n0.21\n**\n0.07\n0.13\n*\nADOGS\n28.50/3.89\n0.66\n0.04\n0.09\n0.06\n\u22120.13\n*\nSDO\n44.83/11.48\n0.86\n\u22120.21\n***\n\u22120.26\n***\n0.03\n\u22120.19\n***\nAltruism (DG)\n48.76/9.50\n0.07\n0.08\n0.04\n0.02\nGender\na\n0.49/0.50\n0.01\n0.07\n\u22120.10\n0.03\nAcademic performance (\nn\n=\u00a0142)\n0.13\n0.00\n0.21\n0.04\nNote:\nDG, dictator game, BFI, Big Five Inventory, ADOGS, Academic Delay of Gratification\n                           Scale; SDO, Social Dominance Orientation; CLS, Chikui Likelihood Scale.\na\n1, male; 0, female.\n*\np\u00a0<\n0.05.\n**\np\u00a0<\n0.01.\n***\np\u00a0<\n0.001.\nDiscriminant validity\nTable\n5\nshows the correlations between the \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood scale, gender, and academic\n                  performance. In support of the CLS's discriminant validity, neither the CLS nor its\n                  subscales were correlated with participants' gender or academic performance.\nCriterion\u2010related validity\nIn\nPart 1\nof the present study, the criterion\u2010related validity was examined by analyzing the\n                  relationship between the CLS and the \u201cworth\u2010based choices\u201d scale developed by Tang\n                  et al. (\n2014\n). In\nPart 2\n, we sought to examine the criterion\u2010related validity of the CLS by assessing its\n                  relationship with participants' choice behavior in the UG, DG, and intertemporal choice\n                  rather than existing scales (Table\n6\n). We found that the CLS correlated significantly with willingness to accept unfair\n                  allocations in the UG (\nr\n=\u00a00.20,\np\n<\u00a00.01). The result suggested that individuals who were more willing to choose \u201cChikui\u201d\n                  (suffering a loss) would be more likely to accept an unfair offer, which supported\n                  the criterion\u2010related validity of the CLS. However, the CLS was not correlated with\n                  allocating more money to the recipient in the DG (\nr\n=\u00a00.07,\np\u00a0=\n0.21). This finding, together with the correlations of CLS's subscale and the DG\n                  reported in Table\n6\n, suggested that what is measured by allocating more money in the DG is decision makers'\n                  altruism and that the threshold of unfairness measured by willingness to accept unfair\n                  allocations in the UG was more related to \u201cChikui\u201d than to altruism. Furthermore,\n                  CLS scores were not correlated with the degree of discounting in intertemporal choice.\n                  This may be because, in order to reach a decision, decision makers must only assess\n                  the outcomes of a pair of offered intertemporal options (\u201csmall but sooner\u201d and \u201clarge\n                  but later\u201d) on the fixed dimensions, while they have to generate a new dimension and\n                  assign a delayed subjective value (utility) to the single option of \u201cChikui.\u201d\nTable 6.\nCorrelations of the CLS with UG, DG, and intertemporal choice\nMeasures\nCLS\nUG\nDG\nIntertemporal choice\nCLS\n1\nUG\n0.20\n**\n1\nDG\n0.07\n\u22120.00\n1\nIntertemporal choice\n0.04\n0.08\n0.03\n1\nNote\n: CLS, Chikui Likelihood Scale; DG, dictator game; UG, ultimatum game.\n*\np\n<\u00a00.05.\n**\np\n<\u00a00.01.\nEmpirical and incremental validity\nConsidering that volunteers who sacrificed time and energy to help others were taken\n                  as indicators of Chikui behavior both in Tang et al. (\n2014\n) and\nPart 1\nof our study, we attempted to utilize it as an indicator to assess the empirical\n                  validity of the CLS in\n3.4\nPart 2 (which used a different sample). Moreover, considering that raising a child\n                  can cost parents a great deal of money, time, and energy and can be exhilarating and\n                  exhausting, participants who were willing to have more than one child were chosen\n                  to serve as another indicator of the empirical validity. To support the unique empirical\n                  validity of the CLS construct, some covariates that are of relevance to the \u201cChikui\u201d\n                  construct, such as altruism and conscientiousness, were included to account for volunteers\n                  and participants who were willing to have more than one child.\nThe analysis of empirical validity in\nPart 1\nof this study was repeated using another sample. The inclusion of this analysis also\n                  served to address the increased awareness of the need to replicate novel and important\n                  results (Baker,\n2016\n). The results showed that volunteers had significantly higher CLS scores than non\u2010volunteers,\n                  which replicated the finding of\nPart 1\nof this study (Table\n7\n). These results provide repeated evidence in support of the empirical validity of\n                  the CLS.\nTable 7.\nComparing means of groups on the CLS\nGroup\nN\nM\nSD\nt\np\nVolunteers\n185\n735.83\n145.02\n2.53\n0.012\nNon\u2010volunteers\n109\n688.76\n167.78\nParticipants who were willing to have one child\n152\n689.36\n150.67\n\u22123.25\n0.001\nParticipants who were willing to have more than one child\n143\n747.34\n155.65\nIn addition, the results of the added indicator (participants who were willing to\n                  have more than one child) showed that participants who were willing to have more than\n                  one child had significantly higher CLS scores than participants who were only willing\n                  to have one child (Table\n7\n). These results are additional evidence that the CLS exhibits good empirical validity.\nA binomial logistic regression analysis was then conducted with volunteers and participants\n                  who were willing to have more than one child as the dependent variable, the score\n                  of CLS as the independent variable, and participants' age, gender, and conscientiousness\n                  score on the BFI, neuroticism score on the BFI, Grit Scale score, ADOGS score, SDO\n                  score, altruism DG, UG, and intertemporal choice as controlling variables (Table\n8\n). After controlling the variables mentioned earlier, CLS scores were a significant\n                  incremental predictor of volunteers (Exp(\u03b2)\u00a0=\u00a01.002, Wald statistic\u00a0=\u00a04.163,\np\u00a0<\n0.05) and participants who were willing to have more than one child (Exp(\u03b2)\u00a0=\u00a01.002,\n                  Wald statistic\u00a0=\u00a05.685,\np\u00a0<\n0.05).

To examine whether developing a new scale to explain decision\u2010making\n                  phenomena was meaningful, we assessed the validity of the CLS. The result indicated\n                  that the CLS accounted for \u201cChikui\u201d phenomena above and beyond existing relevant constructs\n                  and measures, which meant that it provided an incremental contribution.\nIn all, the results we obtained suggested that the CLS was internally consistent and\n                  distinct from existing relevant measures.\nStudy 2: The Current Relationship between \u201cChikui\u201d Likelihood and Material or Mental\n            Benefit\nStudy 2 was performed to determine whether there was a linear correlation between\n            \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood and real benefit. In our preliminary investigation, it was found\n            that when asked to indicate whether they agreed that \u201csuffering a loss is good fortune\u201d\n            on a 6\u2010point scale (1\u00a0=\u00a0fully disagree; 6\u00a0=\u00a0fully agree), the young Chinese surveyed\n            tended to agree with the dogma, although members of older generations (supermarket\n            customers,\nN\n=\u00a088, 49 women, age over 40\u00a0years) agreed more than the young generation (undergraduate\n            students,\nN\n=\u00a092, 62 women, age range: 18\u201323\u00a0years;\nM\nsupermarket customers\n=\u00a04.76,\nM\nundergraduate students\n=\u00a04.14,\nt\n=\u00a04.1,\np\n<\u00a00.001). It was reasoned that the hidden goal of choosing Chikui (suffer a loss)\n            in the present was to receive more material or mental benefit years later in an unpredictable\n            life situation. Given that obtaining more material benefit requires some time to accumulate,\n            someone who chooses Chikui at a younger age is more likely to gain more in his/her\n            older years. Thus, we hypothesized that age would moderate the association between\n            Chikui likelihood and real benefit. To test the moderation hypothesis, we set up two\n            moderated multiple regression models, each consisting of one independent variable\n            (Chikui), one moderator variable (age), and one outcome variable (material benefit\n            or mental benefit).\nThe independent variable (Chikui likelihood) was measured by the CLS. The material\n            benefit variable was measured using the Socioeconomic Index (SEI; Blau & Duncan,\n1967\n; Duncan,\n1984\n; Hauser & Warren,\n1997\n), which is a widely used indicator of occupational ranking and based on education\n            and income data from the 1950 census (Stevens & Featherman,\n1981\n). The other variable, mental benefit, was measured by subjective well\u2010being (SWB;\n            Andrews & Withey,\n1976\n; Lu,\n1995\n), which refers to how people evaluate their lives and includes variables such as\n            life satisfaction (Zheng, Sang, & Lin,\n2004\n).\nMethod\nParticipants and procedure\nThe participants were 559 (363 women, 64.9%) adults who came from 20 Chinese provinces\n                  and were engaged in over 50 different occupations. The average age of the participants\n                  was 32.1\u00a0years (\nSD\n=\u00a09.59, range\u00a0=\u00a020 to 74). Paper\u2010and\u2010pencil questionnaires were completed by 367\n                  (65.65%) participants in the waiting lounge of the Ji'nan West Railway Station, and\n                  the other 192 (34.35%) participants completed an e\u2010questionnaire distributed through\n                  email. Each participant completed the scales independently and was given a small gift\n                  for their participation.\nMeasures\nChikui likelihood\nWe utilized the CLS, which we developed in Study 1, to assess participants' Chikui\n                     likelihood. Cronbach's alpha was 0.75.\nSocioeconomic Index\nIt has been argued that the SEI for Western countries is not applicable for China\n                     (Li & Song,\n1998\n; Xu,\n2000\n); therefore, we used a revised Chinese SEI proposed by Li (\n2005\n), which has been shown to be efficient in China (\nR\n2\n=\u00a00.81) to compute participants' SEI. The revised Chinese SEI formula is as follows:\nSEI\u00a0=\u00a011.808\u00a0+\u00a03.349\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0length of education\u00a0+\u00a00.573\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0average monthly income (hundred\n                           yuan)\u00a0+\u00a016.075\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0top\u2010level managers\n1\nA manager is the person responsible for planning and directing the work of a group\n                              of individuals, monitoring their work, and taking corrective action when necessary.\n                              According to their different hierarchical levels in an organization, managers can\n                              be classified as top\u2010level managers, middle managers, and low\u2010level managers (Katz,\n1974\n).\n+\u00a011.262\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0middle\u2010level managers\u00a0+\u00a03.738\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0low\u2010level managers\u00a0+\u00a08.942\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0party and\n                           government offices\u00a0+\u00a06.841\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0public institutions\u00a0\u2212\u00a05.694\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0enterprises\u00a0\u2212\u00a026.655\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0discriminated\n                           occupation.\nSubjective well\u2010being\nSWB was assessed by the following question: \u201cHow dissatisfied or satisfied are you\n                     with your life overall?\u201d Answers to this question ranged from 1\u00a0=\u00a0\u201cnot satisfied at\n                     all\u201d to 6\u00a0=\u00a0\u201ccompletely satisfied.\u201d This question was borrowed and modified from the\n                     Life Satisfaction scale (Campbell,\n1976\n), which is the most commonly used measure in the SWB literature (Dolan, Peasgood,\n                     & White,\n2006\n; Marsh & Bertranou,\n2012\n).\nControl of common method biases\nTo control common method biases, in the questionnaire design, we used the Podasakoff,\n                  MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (\n2003\n) method as follows: (i) participants complete the questionnaire anonymously, and\n                  facilitators ensure the subjects know that the survey is only for group study, not\n                  for individual analysis; (ii) each part of the questionnaire measures different points\n                  and has different scoring rules; (iii) each part of the questionnaire has a different\n                  reaction statement. Some have a probability from 0 to 100, some are in agreement from\n                  1 to 6, and some are fill\u2010in\u2010the\u2010blanks.\nIn addition, Harman's single\u2010factor test (Harman,\n1976\n; Podasakoff et al.,\n2003\n) was used to check for the potential for common method bias. Harman's single factor\n                  test is a widely used technique to diagnose common method variance (e.g., Andersson\n                  & Bateman,\n1997\n; Aulakh & Gencturk,\n2000\n; Greene & Organ,\n1973\n; Krishnaveni & Deepa,\n2013\n; Schriesheim, Kinicki, & Schriesheim,\n1979\n). Therefore, we entered all the variables in the study into exploratory factor analysis\n                  using unrotated principal component factor analysis and principal component analysis\n                  with varimax rotation to determine the number of factors that are necessary to account\n                  for the variance in the variables. The factor analysis revealed the presence of six\n                  distinct factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 rather than a single factor. The\n                  six factors accounted for 59.45% of the variance, and the largest factor was found\n                  to account for only 17.7% of the variance. Thus, no general factor was apparent. According\n                  to the two criteria, there was no common method bias problem in this study.\nResults and discussion\nPreliminary analyses\nThe summary statistics (i.e., means, standard deviations, Cronbach's alphas, and intercorrelations)\n                  for the variables under study are shown in Table\n9\n.

The CLS score explained 7.9% of the SEI variance and 5.8% of the SWB variance.\n                  This result supported our hypothesis that there would be a linear correlation between\n                  CLS scores and real benefits.\nTable 10.\nModerating effect of age\nModel\nPredictor variables\nSEI\nSWB\nModel 1\nModel 2\nModel 3\nModel 1\nModel 2\nModel 3\nStep 1\nControl variable\nGender\n\u22120.22\n***\n\u22120.13\n***\n\u22120.14\n***\n0.07\n0.08\n*\n0.07\nEducation years\n0.19\n***\n0.16\n***\n0.16\n***\nWorking years\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.11\n\u22120.13\nStep 2\nIndependent variable\nChikui\na\n0.21\n***\n0.19\n***\n0.25\n***\n0.25\n***\nAge\na\n0.34\n*\n0.33\n**\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.02\nStep 3\nChikui\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0age\na\n0.12\n***\n0.04\nR\n2\n0.05\n0.23\n0.24\n0.05\n0.11\n0.11\n\u0394\nR\n2\n0.05\n0.18\n0.01\n0.05\n0.06\n0.00\nF\n27.55\n***\n55.39\n***\n44.79\n***\n8.49\n***\n11.82\n***\n9.96\n***\n\u0394\nF\n27.55\n***\n66.04\n***\n10.21\n***\n8.49\n***\n16.41\n***\n0.70\nNote:\nSEI, socioeconomic index; SWB, subjective well\u2010being.\na\nStandardized regression coefficient.\n*\np\n<\u00a00.05.\n**\np\n<\u00a00.01.\n***\np\n<\u00a00.001.\nThe results presented in Table\n10\nindicate that age significantly moderated the relationship between CLS score and\n                  SEI (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.12,\np\n<\u00a00.001). These moderating effects explained 1.4% of the SEI variance.\n33\nHowever, the results revealed that age did not moderate the relationship between\n                  CLS score and SWB (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.04,\np\n>\u00a00.05).\nTo interpret the significant moderating effects, it was preferable to graphically\n                  represent them according to the procedure suggested by Preacher, Curran, and Bauer\n                  (\n2006\n). This procedure consists of calculating the regression equations involving the independent\n                  variables (CLS score) and the dependent variable (SEI) according to the low and high\n                  levels of the moderating variable (age), which correspond to one standard deviation\n                  below the average and one standard deviation above the average, respectively. Figure\n2\ndemonstrates that the relationship between CLS score and SEI grew stronger as age\n                  increased.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nRelationship between CLS scores and SEI for young and old people. CLS, Chikui Likelihood\n                           Scale\nCaption\nRelationship between CLS scores and SEI for young and old people. CLS, Chikui Likelihood\n                              Scale\nIn addition to plotting the moderating effects, we conducted simple slope analyses\n                  (Preacher et al.,\n2006\n). The simple slope of the regression of SEI onto CLS scores was significant when\n                  age was high (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.07,\nt\n(540)\u00a0=\u00a09.35,\np\n<\u00a00.001) and nonsignificant when age was low (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.01,\nt\n(540)\u00a0=\u00a01.60,\np\n>\u00a00.05). Therefore, the results of the simple slope analyses partly corroborated\n                  the hypothesis that age would moderate the association between Chikui likelihood and\n                  real benefits (Figure\n2\n).\nIn this study, we utilized the CLS to determine whether there was a linear correlation\n                  between CLS scores and real benefits (either material or mental). The resulting findings\n                  revealed that CLS scores could positively predict SEI and SWB, suggesting that people\n                  who are more likely to choose Chikui are more likely to be satisfied with their life\n                  overall and to receive more material rewards. It is therefore relatively safe to say\n                  that \u201csuffering a loss is good fortune\u201d is not a myth but reality.\nTable\n10\nshows the regression results. Most importantly, the predicted two\u2010way interaction\n                  was significant in the analysis of SEI. Simple slope analyses were conducted to illustrate\n                  the nature of the two\u2010way interaction (Aiken & West,\n1991\n). More specifically, the CLS was more positively related to SEI as people aged. However,\n                  this effect was not observed between CLS scores and SWB. This result indicated that\n                  age moderated the relationship between Chikui likelihood and SEI but not the relationship\n                  between Chikui likelihood and SWB.\nStudy 3: The Reverse\u2010predictive Effect of CLS Scores on Later Material or Mental Benefits\nStudy 2 showed that the current relationship between CLS scores and material benefits\n            (but not mental benefits) is stronger for older people than for younger people. One\n            possible explanation is that a person's material gains must be accumulated over time,\n            whereas mental benefits may not. To test this possibility, inspired by the finding\n            that preschool children's\ndelay of gratification\ncan predict long\u2010term coping and adjustment (Funder, Block, & Block,\n1983\n; Mischel, Shoda, & Peake,\n1988\n), we wanted to explore whether CLS scores could predict a person's long\u2010term material\n            or mental benefit. We conjectured that the time interval would moderate the relationship\n            between CLS scores and material benefits more heavily than it moderates the relationship\n            between CLS scores and mental benefits.\nThe ideal way to do this is to conduct a longitudinal study. However, this method\n            was not possible within the time constraints of the study. Therefore, we tried an\n            alternative way to collect supporting evidence. Instead of measuring people's \u201cChikui\u201d\n            likelihood first and then their material or mental benefit years later, we measured\n            people's present material or mental benefit and then asked them to assess their CLS\n            score from years ago. If there was a correlation between people's present material\n            or mental benefit and their retrospective CLS score, we termed it a reverse\u2010predictive\n            effect of the CLS score on later material or mental benefit. Study 3 attempted to\n            investigate this possibility. There was some empirical evidence demonstrating that\n            the retrospective method we intended to use was effective (Bailey, Nothanagel, & Wolfe,\n1995\n; Melamed,\n1993\n; O'Gorman,\n1982\n; Watson et al.,\n2013\n).\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of three groups of college graduates were sampled. The first group comprised\n                  1\u2010year alumni of Shandong Normal University; it included 142 alumni (99 women, 69.71%)\n                  aged 20 to 26\u00a0years (\nM\n=\u00a022.89,\nSD\n=\u00a01.23).\nThe second group comprised 10\u2010 to 13\u2010year alumni of Shandong Normal University; it\n                  included 171 alumni (112 women, 65.5%) aged 31 to 39\u00a0years (\nM\n=\u00a034.01,\nSD\n=\u00a05.61).\nThe third group consisted of 75 adults who graduated from university more than 20\u00a0years\n                  prior (30 women, 40%) and were aged 40 to 74\u00a0years (\nM\n=\u00a049.56,\nSD\n=\u00a08.46). The participants were adult passengers departing from Ji'nan West Railway\n                  Station, and the data collection took place in the waiting lounge of the railway station.\nMeasures\nThe measures employed in Study 2 were also used in this study. In addition to measuring\n                  each subject's current CLS score (i.e., the CLS score assessed for the present) as\n                  in Study 2, we measured their imagined past CLS score (i.e., the CLS score recalled\n                  from the past). The instruction for recalling the \u201cCLS score for the past\u201d was given\n                  as follows:\n\u201cFor each scenario, please write 2 values: one that reflects the likelihood that you\n                        would do the same thing as the person described, and a second that reflects the likelihood\n                        that you personally would have done this when you were a college student.\u201d\nAn example of the 24 scenarios measuring Chikui likelihood (\n) was as follows:\nDuring an outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the food industry\n                        was severely affected. However, a restaurant owner did not lay off any employees and\n                        paid full salaries on time.\nResults and discussion\nPreliminary analyses\nTable\n11\nshows the means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations among the variables used\n                  in Study 3. Figure\n3\ndepicts the comparison of CLS scores assessed for the present and CLS scores recalled\n                  for the past. All variables were analyzed with two\u2010way ANOVAs with a repeated factor\n                  \u201cCLS score\u201d (present vs. past) and a between\u2010subject factor \u201cgroup\u201d (1\u2010year alumni,\n                  10\u2010 to13\u2010year alumni, and 20+\u2010year alumni).

Pairwise comparisons showed that both 10\u2010 to 13\u2010year alumni's CLS scores\n                  (present and past) and 20+\u2010year alumni's CLS scores (present and past) were significantly\n                  higher than 1\u2010year alumni's CLS scores (present and past). The results also showed\n                  a significant interaction effect between CLS score and group,\nF\n(2, 385)\u00a0=\u00a015.83,\np\n<\u00a00.001. A further simple effect analysis revealed that 1\u2010year alumni's CLS scores\n                  assessed for the present (705.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0170.82) were lower than those of other groups (10\u2010\n                  to 13\u2010year alumni (776.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0159.51), 20+\u2010year alumni (848.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0257.95)),\nps\n<\u00a00.001.

CLS, Chikui Likelihood Scale\nOur preliminary investigation showed that the older generation agrees more with \u201csuffering\n                  a loss is good fortune\u201d than the younger generation, and Study 2 showed that individuals'\n                  CLS scores increased with age. Those findings were consistent with the present finding\n                  that the past CLS scores collected by the retrospective method were lower than the\n                  current CLS scores and that there was no significant difference in past CLS scores\n                  among the groups. This consistency to some extent implied that the retrospective method\n                  was reliable.\nReverse\u2010predictive effect of Chikui likelihood on SEI and SWB\nWe used hierarchical regression to test the reverse\u2010predictive effect of CLS scores\n                  recalled for the past on SEI and SWB.

That is, CLS scores recalled\n                  for the past were correlated with higher levels of SEI in the present. This effect\n                  was strengthened as the interval between the time point of the memories and the present\n                  increased. Apparently, the prediction of SEI from earlier past CLS scores presented\n                  a time lag and an accumulated effect. This finding is consistent with a remark by\n                  Zheng Banqiao: \u201cLosers gain more gradually (\u4e8f\u8005\u76c8\u4e4b\u6e10).\u201d However, this effect was not\n                  found in the relationship between Chikui likelihood and mental benefit.\nIn sum, Study 3 duplicated the result of Study 2. The current CLS score was positively\n                  related to SEI and SWB. Furthermore, Study 3 verified the conjecture derived from\n                  Study 2. That is, the positive effect of Chikui likelihood on SEI became more significant\n                  as people aged, but the effect of Chikui likelihood on SWB did not change with time.\n                  We found that CLS scores recalled for the distant past (over 20\u00a0years) could significantly\n                  positively predict SEI, but this was not the case for the near past (1\u2010year alumni\n                  and 10\u2010 to 13\u2010year alumni). This effect was not found in the relationship between\n                  Chikui likelihood and mental benefits, which suggests that mental reward is gained\n                  spontaneously.\nGeneral discussion\nTo answer the question of whether the long\u2010lasting Chinese dogma \u201c\u5403\u4e8f\u662f\u798f\u201d (suffering\n            a loss is good fortune) can provide a satisfactory account for taking a single option\n            that will result in apparent loss in our modern society, we first developed an anecdote\u2010based\n            scale to measure \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood. The unique features of the scale are as follows:\n            (i) each item that was supposed to measure \u201cChikui\u201d was making a decision over whether\n            to take a single option rather than choose from a pair of options, which was used\n            in previous studies on suffering a loss (i.e., Tang et al.,\n2014\n); (ii) each \u201cChikui\u201d item is a rephrased anecdote of celebrities before they were\n            famous; and (iii) the \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood was then measured by \u201cwalking in another\n            person's shoes\u201d (C. R. Rogers, 1902\u20131987), which means indicating the likelihood that\n            a responder would act in the same way that was described.\nThree factors (Chikui for conscience, Chikui for wealth, and Chikui for reputation)\n            were extracted by an exploratory factor analysis, and the three\u2010factor construct was\n            shown to be reliable and valid by the results of a CFA. Moreover, the convergent,\n            discriminant, and incremental validity of the CLS were supported by analyzing the\n            relationships between the CLS and other relevant variables within the \u201cnomological\n            network.\u201d The result indicated that the developed CLS possessed incremental validity\n            above and beyond existing relevant constructs and measures when accounting for \u201cChikui\u201d\n            phenomena.\nWe then found that CLS scores were higher for those who chose \u201cChikui\u201d (e.g., volunteers\n            or participants who were willing to have more than one child) than those who did not\n            and that CLS scores could positively predict SEI and SWB. These results suggest that\n            \u201cChikui\u201d is somewhat like a competency that people need to be successful in their\n            lives.\nThe good fortune (\u798f) described in the dogma, in terms of material or mental benefits,\n            was measured by SEI and SWB in the present study. As for mental benefits, our findings\n            revealed a relationship between \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood and mental benefit. That is, the\n            more likely a person is to choose Chikui, the happier that person currently is. This\n            is true regardless of age. This finding is consistent with what Zheng Banqiao said:\n            \u201cMiss a move, take a step back, for immediate peace of mind, not in the hope of later\n            reward\u201d\n42\n(Barme & Jaivin,\n1992\n).\nMoreover, we found that Chikui likelihood was correlated not only with immediate peace\n            of mind (mental benefit) but also with immediate or later reward (material benefit).\n            Although Zheng Banqiao did not hope for a later reward to result from Chikui, we found\n            a reverse\u2010predictive effect of \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood on later material benefit only\n            when the past CLS score was recalled from more than 20\u00a0years prior. The observation\n            that the past CLS score that was recalled from more than 20\u00a0years prior was correlated\n            with SEI is reasonable given that a person's material gains are accumulated over time.\n            In short, our findings suggested that choosing Chikui can result in not only mental\n            benefits but also material benefits, and not only immediate rewards but also later\n            rewards if time permits. It can, therefore, be stated confidently that \u201csuffering\n            a loss is good fortune\u201d is not a myth but a certain reality.\nThe revealed material or mental benefits are supportive to our conjecture that \u201cthere\n            exists an extra dimension that is not offered but self\u2010generated dimension.\u201d Otherwise,\n            there will be no \u201cgain\u201d dimension in the space to represent the material or mental\n            benefits we found and reported. The three factors (Chikui for conscience, Chikui for\n            wealth, and Chikui for reputation) we generated by applying factor analysis are very\n            likely to be a good candidate for any extra dimension (D\nj\n) (Figure\n1\nb).\nUsing the option\u2010representing framework in Figures\n1\nas a basis, it would be interpretable and easy to make theoretical sense of the present\n            findings. That is,\nwithout\nthe extra dimension (D\nj\n) in mind, the decision maker had to assign a value (utility) to the option on the\n            offered dimension(s) and obey the principle of value maximization (Figure\n1\na). Thus, when faced with a pair of choices, the decision maker's only choice is to\n            behave according to the jungle law of \u201cachieving rewards and avoiding punishments\u201d\n            or, when offered\na single option\n, act as \u201cWhen it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise,\n            they stopped still.\u201d (\nThe Art of War\n43\n).\nIn contrast,\nwith\nthe extra dimension (D\nj\n) in mind, the decision maker will be able to assign a delayed subjective value to\n            the option on the newly generated dimension. The material or mental benefits we found\n            and reported are well above and beyond what is represented in a one\u2010dimensional or\n            multidimensional space (Figure\n1\nb). Once the value (utility) assigned to the option on the newly generated dimension\n            (D\nj\n) is greater than that assigned to the option on the offered dimension (D\ni\n), to take an option that results in loss is no longer a puzzling \u201cparadox\u201d but a\n            must for us to do in a very natural way.\nWe therefore reason that those who choose to \u201cChikui\u201d (suffer a loss) are those who\n            have assigned a greater delayed subjective value to the option on the newly generated\n            dimension.\nThere were four potential limitations to our study. First, we only conducted a cross\u2010sectional\n            study in Study 3, whereas it would be preferable to measure Chikui likelihood earlier\n            and then track the material and mental benefit of our participants years later. In\n            the absence of a longitudinal study, our findings are suggestive but do not prove\n            causality, and the following two questions therefore remain unaddressed: (i) we are\n            unable to confirm whether the correlation found in Study 2 means that it is the belief\n            that boosts both financial and psychological well\u2010being, rather than the reverse (i.e.,\n            greater present material benefit may increase present \u201cChikui\u201d likelihood). Only a\n            longitudinal study can fully assess this relationship, and (ii) we cannot confirm\n            why current Chikui likelihood was more predictive of SEI than recalled Chikui likelihood\n            for the 10\u2010 to 13\u2010year alumni (the opposite of what we predicted). If a longitudinal\n            SEI (rather than recalled Chikui likelihood) was measured a decade ago and the result\n            was the opposite of what we predicted, the notion of \u201csuffering a loss is good fortune\u201d\n            would be challenged and shown to be contradictory. However, the present data leave\n            it an open question as to whether this is true or not.\nSecond, the measurement of mental benefit in our study was not a state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art\n            assessment. To shorten the length of our questionnaire, the Life Satisfaction Scale\n            (Campbell,\n1976\n), which is a concise measurement and the most commonly used measure in the SWB literature\n            (Dolan et al.,\n2006\n; Marsh & Bertranou,\n2012\n), was adopted in the present study. It would certainly be helpful if future studies\n            were able to utilize a modern instrument such as the Gallup World Happiness Report\n            to measure participants' mental benefits.\nThird, considering the great length of time and number of measurements involved, not\n            all subscales of the Big Five Inventory were measured to determine the convergent\n            validity of the CLS. Thus, our conclusion regarding the correlation between the CLS\n            and the Big Five Inventory may be inconclusive given that only the neuroticism and\n            conscientiousness subscales of the Big Five Inventory, which we believe were relevant\n            to the CLS, were assessed in the present study.\nLast, although Studies 2 and 3 used Harman's single factor test to check for common\n            method variance and the results suggested common method bias was unlikely to confound\n            the results, it could be argued that this claim is likely to be incomplete because\n            Harman's test is insensitive (Podasakoff et al.,\n2003\n). In future studies, using multiple sources for data collection would be helpful\n            for minimizing this problem.\nTaken together, our findings suggest that the traditional Chinese dogma \u201c\u5403\u4e8f\u662f\u798f\u201d (suffering\n            a loss is good fortune) might play a \u201cnudge\u201d role in how objectives of a green economy\n            and sustainable development can be achieved.\nWe are living in a rapidly changing environment (Wei, Tao, Liu, & Li,\n2017\n). In the context of transition to a green economy and sustainable development, if\n            our vision is strictly limited to the space where a single option that will result\n            in apparent loss was represented by a fixed set of dimensions (e.g., any dimension\n            that represents exploiting natural resource wealth), it is unlikely that the objectives\n            of a green economy and sustainable development will be achieved.\nIn fact, at present, millions of Chinese are being faced with a single offered option\n            that will result in apparent loss such as compress, suspend, or close a profitable\n            family business or state\u2010owned enterprise. For instance, in Shandong Province, there\n            are about six million livestock and poultry farms that would have been shut down or\n            relocated if the livestock pollution requirements were not met before 2017 (Zhao,\n2016\n). In addition, over one million fishermen (187,000 fishing boats) in China coped\n            with the fishing moratorium from May 1 to September 1 in the East China Sea, the Yellow\n            Sea, the Bohai Sea, and the South China Sea (Chu,\n2017\n), and the steel industry in China will cut crude steel capacity by 100 to 150 million\n            tons over the next 5\u00a0years (Lu,\n2016\n).\nTo ensure success in the mission of shutting down the businesses that are still making\n            money and that millions of people live on, the key issue is whether the decision maker\n            and policy maker are aware of the extra (hidden green) dimension (D\nj\n), which represents the single option that will result in apparent loss. In this sense,\n            efforts to enhance environmental protection consciousness (such as that proposed by\n            the government or an NGO) do, in fact, emphasize that there is an invisible \u201cgreen\u201d\n            dimension. The purpose of thinking green is to make it clear that choosing to \u201cChikui\u201d\n            (suffer a loss) on an offered dimension that represents exploiting natural resource\n            wealth will gain something on an extra dimension that represents reducing environmental\n            pollution and ecological impact. That an individual or organization, at present, should\n            gain less, gain nothing, or even lose something (Chikui) in return for green and sustainable\n            development in the future is exactly what the philosophy of \u201csuffering a loss is good\n            fortune\u201d prescribes.\nIn sum, our findings offer insights into the relationship between short\u2010sighted self\u2010interest\n            and long\u2010term perspectives in real\u2010world decision making. The decision\u2010making approach\n            derived from \u201csuffering a loss is good fortune\u201d might enlighten policy makers and\n            managers in state administration and promote green development and green lifestyles\n            as the country seeks to balance economic growth and environmental protection. These\n            findings also provide an empirical reference for young people who are entering society\n            and must choose among survival rules for life.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China\n            (31671166; 31471005; 71201163), MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Liberal Arts\n            and Social Sciences Foundation (15YJC190032), Foundation for the Supervisor of Beijing\n            Excellent Doctoral Dissertation (20138012501), and CAS Key Laboratory of Behavioral\n            Science, Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y5CX052003).

Quality\n         of life was assessed using the SF\u201012 questionnaire and depressive symptoms using the\n         Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) rating scale.\nResults\nThe characteristics of the two samples were strictly similar. Persons with sensitive\n         skin and very sensitive skin were more numerous in summer than in winter. In both\n         surveys, the degree of sensitivity was significantly higher in the female population.\n         Quality of life was worse in people with sensitive or very sensitive skin, above all\n         in its psychological component \u2013 the more sensitive the skin, the more the quality\n         of life deteriorated. There was no significant relationship between depressive symptoms\n         and skin sensitivity in the \u2018very sensitive\u2019 or \u2018sensitive\u2019 groups.\nConclusion\nOur study was the first to show seasonal changes in skin reactivity and to study\n         the psychological impacts of sensitive skin.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

This study, for the first time, investigates\n               the association of pets with physiological and psychological parameters in these patients.\n               A questionnaire concerning pets was sent to 104 lung transplant recipients. Lung function\n               tests, levels of exhaled nitric oxide (FE\nNO\n), need for antibiotic treatments and hospitalizations, creatinine clearance, body\n               mass index (BMI) and demographic data were assessed. Additionally, the questionnaire\n               of life satisfaction (FLZ), a question on summarized life satisfaction (LS), the life\n               orientation test (LOT), the hospital anxiety depression scale (HADS) and the social\n               support questionnaire (F\u2010SozU) were assessed.\nResponse rate was 86%. Fifty\u2010two percent defined themselves as pet owners, whereas\n               48% did not. The two groups did not differ in demographic or physiological data. Significant\n               differences in FLZ (79/65, p = 0.04), in LS (4.3/3.9, p = 0.01), LOT (32/29, p = 0.006)\n               and F\u2010SozU (4.5/4.2, p = 0.04) were found in favor of pet owners. In lung transplant\n               recipients keeping pets the frequency of somatic complications is not higher compared\n               to lung transplant recipients without pets. After lung transplantation, pets are associated\n               with a better quality of life.\nIntroduction\nCompanion animals potentially serve as reservoirs for zoonotic infections, particularly\n            in immunocompromised persons (\n1\n,\n2\n). Examples of recognized zoonotic diseases are enteric infections with\nSalmonella\n,\nCampylobacter\nand\nEscherichia\n, or respiratory infections with\nBordetella\nand\nMycobacterium\n, to name only a few. The immunocompromised host is more susceptible to infection,\n            and suffers a more serious course once an infection has started. Due to these considerations\n            and the fact that lung transplant recipients are especially predisposed to infections\n            and inhaled pollution, many lung transplant programs warn against pets. However, scientific\n            data supporting these recommendations in immunosuppressed individuals are scarce (\n1\n,\n2\n). In the specific case of lung transplant recipients such information is almost completely\n            lacking (\n3\n). Concerning pet husbandry we advise our lung transplant recipients according to\n            the CDC guidelines regarding organ transplant recipients holding pets (\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/bonemarrow_transplant.htm\n). In brief, contact with reptiles, baby chicks, stray animals, ill pets and exotic\n            pets are discouraged. Furthermore, cleaning out cat litter and feeding animals with\n            raw eggs or meat products should be avoided. More detailed recommendations have been\n            published recently (\n4\n).\nOn the other hand, numerous studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of companion\n            animals on human health and well being. There is now evidence that animal companionship\n            is associated with lower blood pressure and plasma triglyceride levels (\n5\n), with a beneficial effect on survival after acute coronary events (\n6\n), with increased physical activity (\n7\n,\n8\n), with improved coping strategies after stressful life events (\n9\n-\n11\n), with reduced loneliness (\n12\n), with anxiolytic properties (\n13\n), with better quality of life (QoL) (\n14\n) and with higher social support (\n15\n). As a consequence of the close human animal bond, the relevance of owner responses\n            to companion animal death have been recognized and investigated (\n16\n-\n18\n), and a \u201cpet separation syndrome\u201d has been described (\n19\n).\nDue to the various potential benefits of companion animals, in our lung transplant\n            program we are less restrictive concerning pet husbandry than other centers. Therefore,\n            many of our lung transplant recipients have pets. To our knowledge, the impact of\n            pet ownership on somatic health and QoL has not yet been studied in this group of\n            patients. The rationale of the present cross\u2010sectional study was to investigate the\n            association of companion animals with physiological parameters (lung function, pulmonary\n            and nonpulmonary infections, required hospitalizations) and psychological parameters\n            (anxiety, depression, self\u2010esteem, social support) in lung transplant recipients with\n            and without pets, respectively.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy population and procedure\nThe lung transplant program of the University Hospital of Zurich started in 1992.\n               When the study took place, about 180 patients had been transplanted and 110 were still\n               alive. Of these, 41 (37%) were patients with cystic fibrosis and 30 (27%) were patients\n               with COPD. At present, about 20 transplants are performed yearly and the overall 5\u2010year\n               survival rate is 75%.\nThe present study was conducted between January and March 2005 among all sufficiently\n               German speaking patients of the lung transplant program of the University of Zurich,\n               Switzerland. The questionnaire was delivered by mail and included a stamped return\n               envelope. One reminder follow\u2010up call or personal contact was made with patients who\n               did not return the questionnaire within 4 weeks of the initial mailing. Clinical information\n               was obtained from the charts of the patients.\nThe Ethics Committee of our hospital approved all study procedures and written informed\n               consent was obtained.\nInstruments\nPatients defined themselves as pet holder or not by selecting between two differently\n               coloured, 8\u2010item questionnaires. The following information was obtained from the pet\n               holders: type of pet, duration of possession, extent of daily contact, where the pet\n               lives (outdoors, indoors or both), who handles the pet and their feces and who feeds\n               it. The nonpet holder questionnaire consisted of the following questions: would you\n               like to have a pet, and if so, why don't you have one (due to lung transplantation,\n               due to allergy or others), do you have contact with pets regularly, and, if so, to\n               what animals and what kind of contact (feeding, care or other). Both groups were asked\n               whether they think pet ownership is a problem for lung transplant recipients and whether\n               they believe pets to have a positive impact on well being of the owner.\nThe Questions on Life Satisfaction\nModules\n(FLZ\nM\n) is a short questionnaire for assessing general and health\u2010related quality of life\n               ((HR)QoL). It consists of two 8\u2010item modules, \u201cGeneral Life Satisfaction\u201d and \u201cSatisfaction\n               with Health\u201d. The respondent rates each item twice, once for the subjective importance\n               of the aspect of life or health addressed, and once for the degree of satisfaction\n               in that area. The two ratings are combined into a \u201cweighted satisfaction\u201d score. A\n               German\u2010language version has been validated (\n20\n). In an additional question the patients were asked to rate their summarized life\n               satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 5 (5 = extremely satisfied).\nThe life orientation test (LOT) (\n21\n) was used as a measure for dispositional optimism/pessimism. The LOT is a 12\u2010item\n               (8 target items, 4 fillers) self\u2010report scale and represents a measure of expectation\n               about positive outcome in general, using a 5\u2010point\u2010scale from 1 (strongly disagree)\n               to 5 (strongly agree). The LOT has been validated in a German\u2010language version (\n22\n).\nThe hospital anxiety depression scale (HADS) measures anxiety and depression in physically\n               ill patients (\n23\n). The HADS consists of seven items, each scale with a 4\u2010point Likert\u2010type scale.\n               A total score of >10 on each scale is regarded as indicative of a clinical diagnosis\n               of anxiety or depression, a total score in the range of 8 to 10 is borderline, and\n               values of <8 are interpreted as clinically insignificant. The HADS is widely used\n               (\n24\n) and a German\u2010language version of the HADS has been standardized (\n25\n).\nThe Social Support Questionnaire (F\u2010SozU) consists in its short form of 14 items with\n               a 5\u2010point Likert\u2010type scale. The questionnaire measures perceived and anticipated\n               social support, validated in the German\u2010language version (\n26\n).\nIn gathering medical information, we extracted the data from the most recent lung\n               function tests and screened the charts for antibiotic therapies in the last 12 months\n               other than those initiated after routine surveillance bronchoscopies. Furthermore,\n               all unscheduled hospitalizations were collected. Creatinine clearance from the first\n               routine labwork after filling out the questionnaires was calculated with the Cockcroft\n               formula.\nMultiple serial pulmonary function tests (spirometry and body plethysmography, Sensor\n               Medics Autobox plethysmograph, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) and measurements of exhaled nitric\n               oxide FE\nNO\n(Eco Medics, CLD 88, Munich, Germany), a nonspecific but sensitive parameter for\n               assessing airway inflammation, were available for each patient. The terms baseline\n               values and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) were used as defined elsewhere\n               (\n27\n).\nStatistica software (release 6.0, StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, USA) was used for statistical\n               analyses. Descriptive data were expressed in absolute numbers, percentage, mean and\n               SD. To identify differences between the groups,\nt\n\u2010test for independent sample or chi\u2010square statistics were used where appropriate.\n               p values of <0.05 were considered significant. A Bonferroni adjustment was used for\n               controlling the type I error rate across the eight subscales of the FLZ\nM\n, requiring a p value of 0.006 or less for statistical significance. Correlations\n               were obtained by the Spearman rank method. A multivariate linear regression analysis\n               was performed to correct for age, FEV\n1\nbaseline and time after transplantation (all of which are known predictors of QoL\n               (\n25\n,\n28\n,\n29\n) that also showed significant correlations with several domains of QoL in our analysis,\n               see\n\u201cResults\u201d\nsection), different QoL tests and assessed somatic parameters, respectively, being\n               the dependent variables.\nResults\nParticipants\nSix patients were excluded from the study due to language barriers (Italian speaking).\n               Eighty\u2010nine of 104 questionnaires were returned, thus the response rate was 86%. Forty\u2010six\n               of the participating lung transplant recipients defined themselves as pet owners (52%),\n               whereas 43 (48%) did not. The characteristics of the two groups are summarized in\nTable 1\n. The two groups were evenly distributed with respect to age, sex, underlying disease,\n               time since transplantation and employment status.\nTable 1.\nBaseline Characteristics (n = 89)\nPet owner n = 46\nNo Pet n = 43\np\nAge, years\n43 \u00b1 14 (16\u201067)\n46 \u00b1 12 (22\u201063)\n0.33\nGender, female\n23 (50)\n18 (42)\n0.44\nTransplant type, bilateral\n44 (96)\n40 (93)\n0.59\nMarital status, single\n6 (13)\n7 (16)\n0.66\nEmployed\n21 (46)\n15(35)\n0.3\nMonths after Tx\n45 \u00b1 37 (2\u2010134)\n51 \u00b1 39 (2\u2010142)\n0.48\n1\u20136\n8 (17)\n6 (14)\n0.65\n6.1\u201312\n3 (7)\n2 (5)\n0.7\n12.1\u201324\n7 (15)\n6 (14)\n0.65\n24.1\u201336\n4 (9)\n4 (9)\n0.92\n36.1\u201348\n5 (11)\n3 (7)\n0.52\n> 48.1\n19 (41)\n22 (51)\n0.35\nUnderlying disease\nCF\n17 (37)\n16 (37)\n0.98\nCOPD\n11 (24)\n14 (32)\n0.36\nOther\n18 (39)\n13 (31)\n0.37\nTx = transplantation, cF = cystic fibrosis, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nData presented as mean \u00b1 SD (range) or number (%)\nOf the 43 non\u2010pet owners, 15 (35%) occasionally have contact with pets, mostly cats\n               (9/15) and dogs (8/15); 14/43 (33%) stated that they would like to have a pet but\n               do without one because of transplantation (8/14), allergy (4/14) or other reasons\n               (2/14) (\nTable 2\n).\nTable 2.\nStatements of 89 lung transplant recipients concerning pets\nPet owner n = 46\nNo Pet n = 43\np\n\u201cpets have a positive influence on well being\u201d\n43 (93%)\n36 (83%)\n0.14\n\u201cpets are problematic for patients after LTx\u201d\n4 (9%)\n20 (46%)\n< 0.01\n\u201cI would like to have a pet\u201d\n14 (32%)\n\u201cI do have any contact to pets\u201d\n46 (100%)\n15 (35%)\n< 0.01\ncontact with cats\n31 (67%)\n9 (21%)\n< 0.01\ncontact with dogs\n24 (52%)\n8 (19%)\n< 0.01\nLTx = lung transplantation\nData presented as number (%)\nOf the 46 pet owners, 18 (39%) had a cat, 11 (24%) a dog, and 16 (35%) more than one\n               species.

Numerous,\n            mostly cross\u2010sectional studies have observed significant improvements in HRQoL after\n            lung transplantation (\n30\n-\n36\n), in particular during the first months after transplantation (\n29\n).\nSince in the specific case of lung transplant recipients the potential benefit of\n            companion animals on QoL could be surpassed by the potential risks, the purpose of\n            this descriptive study was to examine different validated QoL scales and somatic health\n            in pet owners versus nonpet owners among lung transplant recipients of our transplant\n            program.\nAbout 50% of our participants own pets. In terms of baseline characteristics the two\n            groups matched very well. Remarkably, in all tested dimensions of QoL pet owners achieved\n            higher ratings. The most impressive difference was found in the LOT, a measure of\n            expectations about positive outcome in general. Even though nonpet holders in the\n            present study achieved considerably higher scores (29 \u00b1 4) than the average of 22,\n            which is regarded as indicative for optimism in the German version of the test (\n22\n), the pet holders surpassed this value by far (32 \u00b1 3, p = 0.006). Similarly, both\n            groups of lung transplant recipients reached higher scores in the questions on general\n            life satisfaction (FLZ\nM\nGeneral) than a normative sample of the general population (65\u00b131 and 79 \u00b1 33 vs.\n            60 \u00b1 37(\n20\n)) and\u2014compared to each other\u2014pet owners, again, attained significantly higher ratings\n            (p = 0.04). Interestingly, in the health related part of the questions on life satisfaction\n            (FLZ\nM\nHealth) the nonpet owners have the same value as the normative sample (74 \u00b1 35 vs.\n            74 \u00b1 41(\n20\n)) whereas our pet owners reached a high score of 87 \u00b1 36 (p = 0.08). Considering\n            the subscales of the FLZ\nM\nin several relevant areas like \u201chousing/living conditions,\u201d\u201cfamily life/children\u201d\u201cpartner\n            relationship/sexuality,\u201d\u201cenergy/zest for life,\u201d\u201cfreedom from anxiety\u201d and \u201cindependence\n            from help,\u201d impressive differences could be found in favor of the pet owners, whereas\n            in no area did the nonpet owners obtain higher ratings. Although the rating for energy/zest\n            for life was relevantly higher in pet owners compared to nonpet owners (12.7 \u00b1 6 vs.\n            9.2 \u00b1 7) or compared to healthy control persons (9.1 \u00b1 6 (\n20\n)) and a better fitness in pet holders was found in earlier studies (\n5\n,\n8\n,\n14\n), we did not find differences in the areas \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201cmobility\u201d between the two\n            groups.\nA further interesting finding of our study was the fact that the perceived and anticipated\n            social support (assessed by the social support questionnaire, F\u2010SozU) was significantly\n            higher in the pet owning group. In a study assessing QoL of patients on the lung waiting\n            list and after lung transplantation, respectively, Archonti et al. (\n37\n) found comparable ratings for the F\u2010SozU in both groups, as well as in the entire\n            study population compared to a healthy control group. An improved social functioning\n            in owners of companion animals has been found in numerous former studies (\n12\n,\n15\n,\n38\n).\nAlthough not statistically significant, the mean scores for anxiety and depression\n            were lower in the pet owner group. Compared to a normative German speaking population\n            (\n25\n), our patients showed similar mean results in anxiety and even better scores in depression\n            particularly in pet owners. Taking a closer look, 13% of the pet owners and 21% of\n            the nonpet owners have borderline or clinical anxiety and 6% and 14% have borderline\n            or clinical depression, respectively. In the above\u2010mentioned normal population (\n25\n), the frequencies of anxiety and depression were 5.9% and 15.8%, respectively. Taken\n            together, it is remarkable that pet owners have only about half of the relative frequency\n            of both anxiety and depression compared to nonpet owners and, compared to normal controls,\n            our pet owners have a decreased depression score. Several previous studies have addressed\n            the subject of depression and anxiety in lung transplant recipients. In a study comparing\n            lung transplant candidates and patients after LTX, Limbos et al. (\n32\n) found a mean HADS anxiety and depression subscale in the nonclinical range in both\n            groups as well. However, borderline or clinical anxiety was found in 44% in the pretransplant\n            group compared to 28% in the posttransplant group; the proportions of borderline or\n            clinical depression were 25% and 8%, respectively. In another cross\u2010sectional study\n            addressing HADS exclusively in female lung transplant recipients (\n31\n), a similarly significantly better score compared to a pretransplant control group\n            could not be found.\nAn interesting finding of the present study is that 83% of the nonpet holders agree\n            with the statement \u201cpets have a positive influence on well being\u201d and 32% of them\n            would like to have a pet. Not unexpectedly, the estimations concerning potential harm\n            that might come from pets varied significantly between the two groups: 9% versus 46%\n            found that pets are problematic for patients after LTX.\nConsidering the potential benefit on QoL associated with pets, the issue of their\n            potential harm needs further attention. Since one would anticipate zoonotic infections\n            or negative impacts of animal associated pollution on lung function, we retrospectively\n            compared numbers of episodes of antibiotic treatment, numbers of hospitalizations,\n            pulmonary function tests and levels of exhaled nitric oxide between the two groups.\n            All of these parameters were distributed equally between the two groups. A significant\n            difference could not be found, with the notable exception of a trend toward less use\n            of antibiotics in the pet owner group.\nRodrigue et al. (\n29\n) found a decrease in several health related QoL domains like affective distress,\n            neurocognitive changes and physical appearance changes in patients more than 1 month\n            after LTX. In our population, we did not find a decrease of the tested parameter comparing\n            patients more than 12 months after transplantation with those who had their transplant\n            less than 12 months ago. Furthermore, with the exception of the HADS, which was slightly\n            higher in pet owners transplanted less than 12 months before the study, all other\n            scores of QoL were in favor of pet owners in both time frames assessed.\nIn a multiple linear regression model we could show that in a relevant subset of the\n            used QoL instruments (e.g. FLZ\nM\n\u201cGeneral LS,\u201d LS \u201cSummarized\u201d and F\u2010SozU), pet ownership acts as significant factor\n            associated with better QoL; remarkably, the extent of this association is comparable\n            to the results of present lung function tests, which has been shown to have an impact\n            on QoL after lung transplantation (\n28\n,\n29\n,\n34\n,\n36\n). On the other hand, also in the multiple linear regression, a relevant impact of\n            pet ownership on the assessed somatic parameters was not found.\nThis study is limited by its cross\u2010sectional and observational nature and the relatively\n            small number of patients. Although previous studies have found positive associations\n            between companion animals and increased QoL, as in the present study, methodological\n            limitations disallow final proof of a causal link and we cannot exclude that higher\n            QoL is preexisting and leads to pet ownership. Another limitation of the present study\n            is the absence of a healthy control group and the possibility that the nonpet owner\n            group contains patients that have eliminated their pet due to pet related difficulties.\n            Since most of our patients own cats and dogs, the results are applicable mainly to\n            this group of animals. Finally, data regarding compliance of the patients with our\n            advice concerning pet ownership are lacking.\nIn summary, this study for the first time demonstrates that holding a companion animal\n            is associated with a considerably increased QoL after lung transplantation. Pet holders\n            do not have more somatic complications, particularly infectious problems than nonpet\n            holders although, in rare cases, devastating zoonotic infections have been described\n            in lung transplant recipients (\n3\n). We conclude that (i) household pets do not seem to have an adverse effect on health\n            after lung transplantation, that (ii) companion animals are associated with a better\n            QoL after lung transplantation and that (iii) compared to healthy control subjects,\n            the psychological well being after lung transplantation remains incessantly high.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

Due to current pollution problems, fish production in the lake greatly\n            declined. Besides fish biology, this study considered a wide array of water databases\n            in selected sites along the lake. Hydrologic and biologic data were compared to that\n            of a reference fish hatchery. Water concentrations of ammonia, manganese, nickel,\n            cadmium, lead and mercury proved hazardous to fish, whereas chromium, copper, iron,\n            zinc, pH, alkalinity, hardness, phosphate, nitrate, and nitrite always fell within\n            acceptable levels.

This revision of Wilson and Cleary's model includes a taxonomy of the\n               variables that often have been used to measure HRQoL. This revision should be useful\n               in research and clinical practice.\nOver the past 30 years, evaluation of quality of life has become increasingly important\n            in health care. Quality\u2010of\u2010life research has increased in methodologic rigor and sophistication.\n            Nevertheless, progress has been hindered by the fact that term \u201cquality of life\u201d has\n            been used to mean a variety of different things, such as health status, physical functioning,\n            symptoms, psychosocial adjustment, well\u2010being, life satisfaction, and happiness. As\n            a consequence, comparing findings across studies to draw conclusions or make application\n            in practice is difficult.\nTo help solve the problem, the term \u201chealth\u2010related quality of life\u201d (HRQoL) was introduced.\n            This term was intended to narrow the focus to the effects of health, illness, and\n            treatment on quality of life. This term excludes aspects of quality of life that are\n            not related to health, such as cultural, political, or societal attributes. Examples\n            are the quality of the environment, public safety, education, standard of living,\n            transportation, political freedom, or cultural amenities. Unfortunately, the distinction\n            between health\u2010related and nonhealth\u2010related quality of life cannot always be clearly\n            made. For example, air pollution contributes to chronic respiratory disease, and long\n            dark winters contribute to seasonal affective disorder. In addition, in chronic illness\n            almost all areas of life are affected by health, and so become \u201chealth\u2010related\u201d (\nGuyatt, Feeny, & Patrick, 1993\n).\nThe current need is for causal models that clearly indicate the elements of HRQoL\n            and their determinants. To date, most models have been focused on the identification\n            of domains. These efforts have helped to define the scope of quality of life by making\n            clear that the term refers to all of life, and not just physical health status. However,\n            identifying domains is not enough. For example, the term \u201cphysical domain\u201d can refer\n            to pathophysiological changes, symptoms, functional deficits, or perceived health\n            status. A causal model with clear distinctions between the most common approaches\n            used to assess HRQoL was developed by\nWilson and Cleary (1995)\n. In this paper we present (a) the theoretical grounding of characteristics of individual\n            and environment, (b) a revised version of their model, and (c) suggestions for applying\n            each of the components in nursing and health care.\nCharacteristics of Individual and Environment\nCharacteristics of individual and environment were included in Wilson and Cleary's\n            original model, but were not discussed in the text. Our revised model is based on\n            the ecological model of McLeroy and colleagues (\nMcLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, & Glanz, 1988\n), as modified by\nEyler et al. (2002)\n, to explicate the multiple layers of influence on health outcomes at both individual\n            and environmental levels in HRQoL. McLeroy and colleagues' model indicates five levels\n            of influence: (a) intrapersonal factors (characteristics of individual), (b) interpersonal\n            factors (formal and informal social support systems), (c) institutional factors (organizations\n            such as schools and healthcare facilities), (d) community factors (relationships among\n            institutions and informal social networks in a defined area), and (e) public policy\n            (local, state, and national laws and policies). For our revised model, everything\n            other than the individual level is considered an environmental influence. Thus, of\n            McLeroy and colleagues' five levels, intrapersonal factors are individual characteristics\n            and the remaining four levels are environmental characteristics.\nCharacteristics of the Individual\nIn accordance with\nEyler et al. (2002)\n, characteristics of the individual in our revised model are categorized as demographic,\n               developmental, psychological, and biological factors that influence health outcomes.\n               Thus, we have added an arrow from characteristics of the individual to biological\n               function. Epidemiological evidence indicates links between individual characteristics\n               and biological function, by identifying attributes or behaviors that increase or decrease\n               the likelihood of developing a given health problem. Biological factors include body\n               mass index, skin color, and family history related to genetically linked disease and\n               disease risk. Demographic factors that commonly have been linked to the incidence\n               of illness are sex, age, marital status, and ethnicity. Although these personal characteristics\n               are relatively unchangeable, they are useful for targeting interventions for specific\n               groups. Targeting requires taking into account the subgroup characteristics in order\n               to design group\u2010level interventions (\nKreuter & Skinner, 2000\n). For example, data from the National Health Interview Survey indicated that African\n               American women have a high prevalence of diabetes, increasing with age (\nAmerican Heart Association [AHA], 2005\n). In addition, they have higher rates of obesity and lower levels of physical activity\n               than do White American women, which further increase the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular\n               disease (\nAHA, 2005\n). Thus, these biological and demographic factors give direction to healthcare providers\n               in targeting whom to screen for health problems such as diabetes, as well as the types\n               of behaviors to target to decrease risk.\nDevelopmental status is also an individual characteristic that is particularly important\n               to consider when explaining health behavior and its resultant effect on biological\n               function. Although developmental status is not a static variable, it cannot be changed\n               or altered by interventions. Nevertheless, interventions designed to change or modify\n               behavior require consideration of an individual's developmental status. For example,\n               women with young children and little time for structured exercise programs might be\n               receptive to learning ways to enhance their daily activities at home and work to reap\n               the cardiovascular benefits (biological function).\nPsychological factors are dynamic, modifiable, and responsive to interventions.\nCox (1982, 2003)\nidentified cognitive appraisal, affective response, and motivation as dynamic intrapersonal\n               factors. Cognitive appraisal includes factors such as knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes\n               toward an illness, treatment, or behavior. Affective response is the emotion evoked\n               including anxiety, fear, sadness, or joy. According to Cox's conceptualization, motivation\n               is based on the theory of self\u2010determination (\nRyan & Deci, 2000\n), which distinguishes between different types of motivation arising from different\n               reasons for performing a given activity. Intrinsic motivation refers to starting and\n               maintaining a behavior because of its inherent enjoyment or satisfaction. It occurs\n               on the basis of a sense of autonomy or self\u2010initiation and choice. Extrinsic motivation\n               for engaging in a behavior is determined by the rewards externally provided rather\n               than by the feelings the behavior engenders, and thus it occurs in environments instead\n               of by individual choice.\nThese dynamic psychological factors can influence one another. For example, a woman\n               who has a lipoprotein level placing her at risk for cardiovascular disease, and who\n               has been overweight and sedentary most of her life, might recall the humiliation she\n               experienced in high school when forced to participate in sports. This thought process\n               results in anxiety (affective response) and lack of motivation to change her lifestyle\n               in response to her increased cardiovascular risk. Another woman at risk for cardiovascular\n               disease might regard walking as an activity within her capability, giving her the\n               initial motivation to begin to change her lifestyle. Her motivation might stem from\n               learning (cognitive response) that physical activity provides cardiovascular benefits,\n               such as walking at moderate levels.\nCharacteristics of the Environment\nFor the revised model, characteristics of the environment are categorized as either\n               social or physical, in accordance with\nEyler et al. (2002)\n. Social environmental characteristics are the interpersonal or social influences\n               on health outcomes, including the influence of family, friends, and healthcare providers\n               (\nMcLeroy et al., 1988\n). For example, significant others can have a strong influence over when and where\n               health care is sought and whether treatment is adhered to. The effect of this social\n               environment is significantly influenced by an individual's cultural heritage, which\n               can affect participation in preventive care as well as treatment. For example, several\n               studies have indicated that Korean women have much lower rates than do White women\n               in participation in clinical breast examinations and mammography (\nChen, Diamant, Kagawa\u2010Singer, Pourat, & Wold, 2004\n;\nCDC, 1997\n). Korean immigrant women with physicians of the same ethnicity have been found to\n               be less likely to have a mammogram than were those with non\u2010Korean physicians (\nJuon, Kim, Shakar, & Han, 2004\n). Also, Korean immigrant women have reported that the emphasis on their roles as\n               mothers in their cultural tradition did not allow them to meet their own needs (\nIm & Cloe, 2001\n).\nPhysical environment characteristics are those settings such as the home, neighborhood,\n               and workplace that influence health outcomes either positively or negatively. For\n               example, neighborhoods with walking and bicycle trails, health clubs, and sports fields\n               are more conducive to physical activity. In contrast, communities that have a high\n               crime rates, poor policing, and high levels of pollution have environments that are\n               not conducive to physical activity.\nRevisions of the Model\nOur revision of\nWilson and Cleary's (1995)\nmodel of HRQoL is shown in the\nFigure\n. Our primary focus was the five boxes in the center of the model, which are five\n            types of measures of patient outcomes. First, biological function (originally biological\n            and physiological variables) is described as focusing on the function of cells, organs,\n            and organ systems. Biological function would be assessed through such indicators as\n            laboratory tests, physical assessment, and medical diagnoses. Second, symptoms (originally\n            symptom status), refers to physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms perceived by\n            a patient. Functional status, the third component, is composed of physical, psychological,\n            social, and role function. Fourth, is general health perceptions, which refers to\n            a subjective rating that includes all of the health concepts that precede it. Fifth,\n            overall quality of life, is described as subjective well\u2010being, which means how happy\n            or satisfied someone is with life as a whole. The arrows indicate the dominant causal\n            associations. Reciprocal relationships might exist, but are not characterized in the\n            figure.\nFigure Figure\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nRevised Wilson and Cleary model for health\u2010related quality of life.

Adapted from \u201cLinking\n                        Clinical Variables with Health\u2010Related Quality of Life: A Conceptual Model of Patient\n                        Outcomes,\u201d by I.B. Wilson and P.D. Clearly, 1995. Copyright by JAMA. Used with permission.\nThe original model was revised in three substantive ways. First, we added arrows to\n            show that biological function is influenced by characteristics of both individuals\n            and environments. Second, the original model included nonmedical factors as an independent\n            influence on overall quality of life. We chose to delete this box, because all nonmedical\n            factors can be categorized as characteristics of either individual or environment,\n            which already were included in the model. Third, in the original model many of the\n            arrows were labeled by examples. The examples tended to restrict characterization\n            of the relationships. Because comprehensive labeling of relationships would be unwieldy,\n            we decided to omit labels on the arrows entirely in the revised model.\nBiological Function\nAccording to the model, biological function (originally called biological and physiological\n               variables) includes the dynamic processes that support life. Biological function is\n               viewed broadly and encompasses molecular, cellular, and whole organ level processes.\n               It can be described as a continuum of ideal function on one end and serious life\u2010threatening\n               pathological function at the other end. Alterations in biological function directly\n               or indirectly affect all components of health, including symptoms, functional status,\n               perceptions of health, and overall quality of life. Optimizing biological function\n               is an integral part of holistic care.\nThe revised model indicates the effects of individual and environmental characteristics\n               on biological functioning, which was not in the original model. The interaction of\n               individual and environmental characteristics also influences biological function.\nEffect of individual characteristics on biological function\nIndividual characteristics influence a person's biological vulnerability and resilience.\n                  Individual genetic characteristics influence biological functioning in congenital\n                  and hereditary diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia. Genetic composition\n                  predisposes people to the development of many diseases, including inflammatory, degenerative,\n                  metabolic, and neoplastic diseases. Psychological characteristics, knowledge, and\n                  attitudes influence choices people make about lifestyle, ultimately affecting biological\n                  function. For example, self\u2010efficacy for exercise influences exercise behavior and\n                  ultimately affects aerobic fitness and biological function.\nEffects of environmental characteristics on biological function\nPhysical and social factors in the environment affect biologic function. For example,\n                  exposure to pathogens in the environment can cause infectious diseases, and living\n                  in a high crime community can lead to traumatic injury.\nEffects of interactions between individual and environment\nThe emerging field of genomic science illustrates the effects of individual environment\n                  interactions on biologic function. Genomics is the study of the functions and interaction\n                  of all genes in the genome (\nGuttmacher & Collins, 2002\n), and the interaction of genes and environmental factors as it applies to the expression\n                  of common disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, colorectal cancer, breast cancer,\n                  and AIDS. For example, because of the gene\u2010environment interaction some life\u2010long\n                  smokers develop chronic obstructive lung disease or lung cancer, but others do not.\n                  Because genetic characteristics cannot be altered, clinical interventions are directed\n                  toward modifying behaviors to reduce the risk of disease.\nSymptoms\nWilson and Cleary\n(1995, p. 61) indicated that moving attention from the biological and physiological\n               variables to symptom variables requires a shift focus from cellular and organism level\n               to a person level. They define symptoms as \u201ca patient's perception of an abnormal\n               physical, emotional, or cognitive state,\u201d which can be categorized as physical, psychological,\n               or psychophysical.\nInstruments to measure symptoms can be classified as global measures, condition\u2010specific\n               measures, and symptom\u2010specific measures. Global measures are broad and include many\n               varied symptoms. The Symptom Impact Inventory is an example of a global measure (\nMiller, Wilbur, Montgomery, Chandler, & Bezruczko, 2001\n). Condition\u2010specific measures are focused on the symptoms associated with a particular\n               condition and include the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (\nGuyatt, Berman, & Townsend, 1987\n) and the Unstable Angina Symptom Questionnaire (\nDeVon & Zerwic, 2003\n). Symptom\u2010specific measures pertain to a particular symptom, such as fatigue as measured\n               with the Piper Fatigue Scale (\nPiper et al., 1989\n) or anxiety and depression as measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\n               (\nZigmond & Snaith, 1983\n).\nThe most common dimensions of symptoms that are measured include frequency, intensity,\n               and distress. Other dimensions that have been incorporated in symptom measures include\n               quality, cause, treatment, consequences, location, and timing. Instruments vary on\n               which dimensions are included and several dimensions might be included in the same\n               instrument.\nA variety of theories are focused primarily on symptoms. The Common Sense Model of\n               Illness (\nLeventhal, Meyer, & Nerenz, 1980\n) is one theory focused on a person's somatic sensation and the process used to attribute\n               the sensation to illness, external life stressors, or benign sensations. People experience\n               sensations and cognitively process the sensations with the background of previous\n               somatic experiences and with information from the environment. The person's cognitive\n               representation of the symptom includes thoughts about its possible identity (heart\n               attack, pulled muscle, influenza), cause, consequence, progression, and cure. The\n               experience, evaluation, and interpretation of symptoms are part of the characteristics\n               of the individual and the environment. For example,\nCameron, Leventhal, & Leventhal (1995)\nfound in a longitudinal study of community\u2010dwelling middle\u2010to\u2010older aged adults that\n               people who experienced symptoms combined with other stressful events reported more\n               negative mood states, rated the symptoms as more serious, reported more distress about\n               the symptoms, and experienced more disruption of daily activities than did people\n               who experienced symptoms without the presence of stressful events. Thus the experience,\n               evaluation, and interpretation of symptoms are influenced by complex interactions\n               with both individual factors (such as knowledge and personality characteristics) and\n               environmental factors (such as interactions with healthcare providers).\nFunctional Status\nWilson and Cleary (1995)\ndefined functional status broadly, as the ability to perform tasks in multiple domains\n               such as physical function, social function, role function, and psychological function.\n               Functional status can be viewed from various perspectives. Traditional models pertain\n               to functional status from the perspective of disability or disablement, focused on\n               the loss of function and its effects on daily life (\nStineman et al., 2005\n). Alternatively, in the revised model we view functional status by focusing on optimization\n               of the function that remains.\nLeidy's (1994)\nframework for functional status is an example of this perspective and it is a useful\n               guide for health care.\nAccording to Leidy's framework, functional status includes four dimensions: functional\n               capacity, functional performance, functional capacity utilization, and functional\n               reserve (\nLeidy, 1994\n). Functional capacity is defined as one's maximal capacity to perform a specific\n               task in the physical, social, psychological or cognitive domains. For example, functional\n               capacity might be one's maximal ability in strength and endurance or in aptitude or\n               memory. The second dimension, functional performance, refers to activities that one\n               performs on a day\u2010to\u2010day basis. Functional performance is an integrated response and\n               is determined by multiple factors, including personal choice, values, and motivation.\n               Functional performance could be assessed by the level of physical activity and energy\n               expended or as self\u2010reported activities across multiple categories. Alternatively,\n               functional performance could be measured by daily memory performance. Functional performance\n               also could be influenced by functional capacity, as in cases when reduced capacity\n               limits performance of day\u2010to\u2010day activities. The third dimension, capacity utilization,\n               refers to the percentage of functional capacity that is used day to day. The fourth\n               dimension, functional reserve, refers to the difference between capacity utilization\n               and functional capacity. People generally do not function at 100% of their capacity\n               on a day\u2010to\u2010day basis, and people with high capacity might actually use only a small\n               percentage of their capacity daily. When functional capacity declines because of health\n               problems, a person might be required to use a higher percentage of capacity or to\n               cut back on daily activities. Capacity utilization is closely related to functional\n               reserve and indicates the unused potential. People with low capacity and very low\n               functional performance could have a fairly large functional reserve.\nMeasures of functional capacity have been widely reported in the scientific literature,\n               and many established measures of this dimension are available. For example, the maximal\n               oxygen uptake is a measure of aerobic capacity and is assessed during a symptom\u2010limited\n               exercise test. The 6\u2010minute walk test and the shuttle walk test are used to measure\n               functional capacity for walking. Similarly, tests of skeletal muscle strength indicate\n               functional capacity for strength. The measurement of functional performance is less\n               advanced. One commonly used measure of functional performance is the Functional Performance\n               Inventory (FPI).\nLeidy (1999)\ndeveloped the FPI with people who had COPD; it has the potential to be appropriate\n               for other groups of people with chronic illness, such as chronic congestive heart\n               failure. In addition, two scales from the SF\u201036 Health Survey (\nWare & Sherbourne, 1992\n) have been used widely to measure functioning: the physical functioning and social\n               functioning scales. The SF\u201036 is a generic measure that can be used with both healthy\n               people and people with chronic illness. Many investigators also have used the Sickness\n               Impact Profile to measure functional performance, but it is an indirect measure of\n               functional performance and a direct measure of functional impairment.\nNo instruments are established for the measurement of capacity utilization and functional\n               reserve. Although the concepts of capacity utilization and functional reserve are\n               not readily measured objectively, they are clinically meaningful and could be measured\n               subjectively.\nIn the revised HRQoL model, multiple factors can affect functional status. For example,\n               functional capacity can be directly affected by biological function and by symptoms,\n               and functional performance can be affected by characteristics of the individual and\n               the environment. In people with COPD, functional capacity can be limited by ventilatory\n               capacity and by symptoms of dyspnea or leg fatigue. However, symptoms alone do not\n               fully account for the decrease in functional capacity. If symptoms are severe enough,\n               they might interfere with day\u2010to\u2010day levels of activity, which might cause a patient\n               to become sedentary and physically deconditioned (decline in functional status). But\n               the extent of the decline in day\u2010to\u2010day activities also could be influenced by individual\n               characteristics, such as self\u2010efficacy and motivation for physical activity, or by\n               social environmental factors, such as social support for physical activity and community\n               safety.\nGeneral Health Perceptions\nWilson and Cleary (1995)\npointed out two defining characteristics of general health perceptions: (a) they\n               integrate all the components that come earlier in the model, and (b) they are subjective\n               in nature. This component is a synthesis of all the various aspects of health in an\n               overall evaluation. Supporting this idea is the finding that the strongest and most\n               consistent predictors of general health perceptions are physiological processes, symptoms,\n               and functional ability, based on a review of 39 studies of the general population\n               (\nBjorner et al., 1996\n). Although general health perceptions are influenced by the earlier components of\n               the model, they nevertheless are different from the others. Thus using measures of\n               other components, such as functioning or symptoms, to assess general health perceptions\n               is not appropriate. Instead, this component is most commonly measured with a single\n               global question to ask people to rate their health on a Likert scale ranging from\n               poor to excellent. Ratings of general health perceptions are used both as single\u2010item\n               measures and items in a battery, as in the SF\u201036 Health Survey (\nWare & Sherbourne, 1992\n).\nWhen rating their health, people typically consider various aspects of their health,\n               as well as the implicit importance of each. Further, men and women differed systematically\n               when evaluating their health in general (\nBenyamini, Leventhal, & Leventhal, 2000\n). Men's health ratings pertained to serious, life\u2010threatening diseases (such as cardiac\n               disease), but women's health ratings included both life\u2010threatening and nonlife\u2010threatening\n               disease (such as arthritis). In addition, gender differences were found in the effect\n               of negative emotion on general health ratings. For men emotion was linked primarily\n               to serious disease, and for women it was linked to a wider variety of life factors.\nOverall Quality of Life\nOverall quality of life, the final component of the model, was characterized by\nWilson and Cleary (1995)\nas subjective well\u2010being related to how happy or satisfied someone is with life as\n               a whole. Over the past 30 years the concept of subjective well\u2010being has developed\n               considerably as a general area of scientific interest (for a comprehensive review,\n               see\nDiener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999\n). Subjective well\u2010being does not represent a single construct; it includes pleasant\n               and unpleasant affect, global judgments of life satisfaction, and satisfaction with\n               individual domains of life (\nDiener et al., 1999\n). The number of life domains varies among authors, depending on the desired level\n               of generality. At a broad level of abstraction, the domains have been characterized\n               as health and functioning, psychological and spiritual, family, social, and economic\n               (\nFerrans, 1990, 1996\n). This characterization is consistent with prevailing views of the domains of quality\n               of life in the literature, although the specific terminology varies somewhat among\n               authors (\nFerrans, 2005\n).\nMany theories and conceptual models have been proposed to explain the components of\n               subjective well\u2010being.\nCampbell, Converse, and Rodgers (1976)\npublished one of the earliest and most influential reports to characterize the determinants\n               of life satisfaction. They described the relationship between the characteristics\n               of the individual and environment and the level of life satisfaction experienced.\n               In their model, life satisfaction is determined by the person's evaluation of attributes\n               of various domains of life. This evaluation is dependent on the person's perception\n               of attributes, as well as internal standards by which those perceptions are judged.\n               Internal standards include personal values, expectation levels, aspiration levels,\n               personal needs, and comparisons with others. Individual perception is influenced by\n               personal characteristics, such as demographic characteristics, general optimism or\n               pessimism, as well as other attributes of personality.\nIn concordance with\nCampbell et al. (1976)\n,\nWilson and Cleary (1995)\nemphasized how patients' values and preferences affect overall quality of life. Because\n               of differences in values, an impairment that makes life not worth living for one person\n               might be considered only a bother for another. For this reason, the importance of\n               values should be part of an assessment of satisfaction with life. Life satisfaction\n               can be measured through a single global question, asking how satisfied the person\n               is with life in general, or through a series of questions about satisfaction with\n               various aspects of life. If scores on a series of questions are simply summed, then\n               each aspect of life is given equal value. However, some instruments include a weighting\n               system to allow for differences in importance for each aspect of life, and thus would\n               indicate differences in values of respondents. Two examples are the Quality of Life\n               Inventory (\nFrisch, 1993\n) and the Quality of Life Index (\nFerrans & Powers, 1992\n;\nFerrans, 1990\n). Measuring the importance of various aspects of life also has an additional advantage.\n               Recently, concern has been expressed about the effect of \u201cresponse shift,\u201d which is\n               a change in internal standards and values in response to significant life events.\n               These changes can occur as a result of cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes\n               used to accommodate to illness (\nSprangers & Schwartz, 1999\n). The implication is that changes in instrument scores might sometimes indicate changes\n               in internal standards, rather than in the attribute of interest. A benefit of using\n               an instrument to measure patients' values is that it allows the investigator to determine\n               whether values have changed over the course of the study. If changes have occurred,\n               they then can be accounted for in the statistical analysis.\nConclusions\nIdentification of the domains of quality of life is an important task that has been\n            reasonably accomplished. However, identification of domains has not remedied the problem\n            of conceptual confusion, nor has narrowing the field to variables that are \u201chealth\n            related.\u201d Lack of precision in terminology about quality of life has resulted in the\n            use of same terms to mean different things. The current need is for models to clarify\n            the critical elements of HRQoL and the causal relationships among them.\nWilson and Cleary's model (1995)\nincludes a useful taxonomy of the variables that commonly have been used to measure\n            HRQoL. Although the model was published in 1995, it has not been widely used. We revised\n            their original model in three substantive ways: (a) adding arrows to show that biological\n            function is influenced by characteristics of both individuals and environments, (b)\n            deleting nonmedical factors, and (c) deleting the labels on the arrows because they\n            tended to restrict characterization of the relationships. We also provided theoretical\n            background for each of the major components of the model and examples of instruments\n            for measuring them. The result is a revised model to advance knowledge and use of\n            the concept of HRQoL in nursing and health care.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

This article reviews some of this growth, and suggests a number\n            of domains in which future research may proceed.\nIntroduction\nMuch has changed in Economics over the past 40 years. One such notable change that\n            I would like to discuss here has been the remarkable rise in the interest shown by\n            economists in subjective variables in general and in particular measures of subjective\n            well\u2010being.\nWhile measures of subjective health have long been used in Economics, seemingly without\n            any particular adverse comment, and subjective evaluations of job, life or income\n            appeared as mainstays in Psychology and Sociology, Economics in the 1970s appeared\n            to be virgin territory in this respect. There were a few notable exceptions to this\n            general aversion to subjective well\u2010being data, and these have actually become very\n            well\u2010cited (Easterlin,\n1974\n; Hamermesh,\n1977\nand Freeman,\n1978\n). But these contributions were rather treated as intellectual curios, and attracted\n            only little attention from Economists in the 1970s and 1980s. In fact, the whole well\u2010being\n            literature seemed to be largely moribund in Economics for roughly 15 years from the\n            end of the 1970s.\nThe economics of happiness really seemed to take off in the 1990s\n1\n, and in a remarkable way. It is in particular worth underlining that as I write four\n            of the 20 most\u2010cited articles ever published in the\nEconomic Journal\nexplicitly have the word \u201chappiness\u201d in their title\n2\n(and two of the three most\u2010cited articles in\nJournal of Public Economics\ndeal with the question of subjective well\u2010being).\n3\nHappiness data have been used for broadly three different purposes, which I shall\n            attempt to review in this article. At the first and simplest level, they were used\n            as left\u2010hand side variables in empirical analyses to answer the question: What makes\n            people happy? The role of labor\u2010force status and income were of particular interest\n            among economists here. Second, the roles were reversed, with subjective well\u2010being\n            now appearing on the right\u2010hand side of equations that were estimated to show what\n            happy people did. The outcomes here ranged from income and productivity to labor\u2010market\n            behavior, marriage, children, morbidity and mortality (Freeman's\n1978\npaper showing that job satisfaction predicted individuals' future job quits in panel\n            data was very much a precursor in this field).\nLast, happiness data have been used to help address a number of economic puzzles,\n            such as:\nIf the self\u2010employed are happier than the employed, why do most of us still work for\n                  other people? (Blanchflower and Oswald,\n1998\nand Frey and Benz,\n2008\n).\nWhy do wages differ so much across industries and occupations? (Clark,\n2003\nand Pischke,\n2010\n).\nHow much inequality should there be in a society? (Clark and D'Ambrosio,\n2015\n).\nHow harmful is inflation compared to unemployment? (Di Tella\net al\n.,\n2001\n).\nHow can we value public goods, such as green spaces, pollution and aircraft noise?\n                  (Van Praag and Baarsma,\n2005\n; Luechinger,\n2009\nand Krekel\net al\n.,\n2016\n).\nMy task here will be to look back at what has been done over the past productive 20\n            years in terms of subjective well\u2010being research. This will cover the three topics\n            mentioned above. But my task is more than that: it is also to set out a kind of wish\n            list of what I would like to see achieved in the next 20 years.\nThe remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section\n2\nconsiders the determinants of well\u2010being, and then Section\n3\naddresses the consequences. Section\n4\ndiscusses some applications of the estimated coefficients in well\u2010being regressions\n            to the labor market and elsewhere, and Section\n5\nsome areas where I think research on well\u2010being may progress in the future. Last,\n            Section\n6\nconcludes.\nThe Correlates of Subjective Well\u2010Being\nThis is in a way the most obvious question that can be asked regarding subjective\n            well\u2010being: What does its distribution look like in terms of observable characteristics?\n            These characteristics can be at both the individual level and at a more aggregate\n            level.\n4\nWe then turn to the essential policy questions of social comparisons and adaptation.\nIndividual Characteristics\nThe individual correlates of various measures of subjective well\u2010being were the subject\n               of some of the very first work in Economics: the role of income and relative income\n               (Hamermesh,\n1977\n), trade unions (Borjas,\n1979\n) and race and sex (Bartel,\n1981\n). The literature since then has grown enormously, and covered a wide variety of attributes\n               of individuals and the jobs that they do.\nPerhaps the most widely\u2010studied of all personal characteristics is income. It is by\n               now almost universally accepted that individuals who are observed to have higher levels\n               of income in cross\u2010section data also report higher levels of subjective well\u2010being.\n               The literature is by now far too vast to survey satisfactorily, but some examples\n               using individual\u2010level data are Kahneman and Deaton (\n2010\n), using the Cantril ladder as the outcome\n5\nand data from the Gallup\u2010Healthways Well\u2010being Index (GHWBI), Luttmer (\n2005\n), using life satisfaction as the outcome and data from the National Survey of Families\n               and Households, and Layard\net al\n. (\n2010\n), using data from the General Social Survey and the German Socio\u2010Economic Panel (SOEP).\n               At the country level, Deaton (\n2008\n) uses data from the Gallup World Poll to show that richer countries have higher average\n               scores on the Cantril ladder. These kinds of empirical analysis introduce income in\n               logarithmic form: this corresponds to the subjective well\u2010being effect of an additional\n               dollar of income being larger for those with lower incomes than for those with higher\n               incomes.\nAfter income, one of the individual attributes that has attracted the most attention\n               is unemployment. Here again, the evidence is pretty much unanimous: unemployment is\n               associated with lower levels of well\u2010being both in cross\u2010sectional data (comparing\n               one individual who is unemployed to another who is in employment) and in panel data\n               (looking at the same individual over time as their labor\u2010force status changes between\n               working and unemployment). This kind of finding was an early staple in psychology\n               (Jahoda,\n1982\n), and has made repeated appearances in the economic literature (Clark and Oswald,\n1994\n; Winkelmann and Winkelmann,\n1998\nand Gr\u00fcn\net al\n.,\n2010\n: see also Layard\net al\n.,\n2012\n)\nOther work has considered characteristics that are of interest in a descriptive sense,\n               but which are not themselves amenable to policy interventions, such as age, sex, ethnicity\n               and country of birth. But it is not because these characteristics cannot be changed\n               that we do not care about them: a good example is the great attention that has been\n               paid to the gender and race patterns of pay in the labor market.\nWith respect to age, one extremely stable finding is that of a U\u2010shaped relationship\n               between subjective well\u2010being and age (two examples are Blanchflower and Oswald,\n2008\nand Cheng\net al\n.,\n2017\n). While this finding is widespread, there is no current agreement on why well\u2010being\n               should behave in this way. Socially\u2010determined explanations have been called into\n               question by research showing the same U\u2010shape in Great Apes (Weiss\net al\n.,\n2012\n).\nThere are notable sex differences in subjective well\u2010being. In particular, women often\n               report higher values on cognitive\u2010evaluate measures than do men, but also higher stress\n               scores (Nolen\u2010Hoeksema and Rusting,\n1999\n). The analysis of GHWBI data in Kahneman and Deaton (\n2010\n) shows that women report more positive affect and higher scores on the Cantril ladder,\n               but also more negative affect and greater stress (see their Table 1). There is debate\n               over the explanation of women's higher satisfaction scores. In the labor market, Clark\n               (1997) considered the potential roles of observable characteristics (such as age and\n               education), selection (of more satisfied women) into the labor market, and different\n               work values in British Household Panel Study (BHPS) data, without being able to fully\n               explain the observed job satisfaction premium in favor of women. He finally suggests\n               a possible role for expectations. If outcomes are related to expectations, and women\n               have lower expectations on the labor market than do men, then any given job outcome\n               will be on average evaluated more positively by women than by men. Suggestive evidence\n               along these lines comes from there being no gender difference in job satisfaction\n               for younger women, women with degrees, women with professional working mothers, and\n               those working in male\u2010dominated workplaces. All four of these groups are likely to\n               have higher expectations regarding the labor market. Sousa\u2010Poza and Sousa\u2010Poza (\n2003\n) noted that the gender job satisfaction gap in BHPS data has been shrinking over\n               time, which is consistent with women's rising expectations, and the most recent contribution\n               using the BHPS finds that it has disappeared completely (Green\net al\n.,\n2018\n). Stevenson and Wolfers (\n2009\n) also find evidence of falling female happiness in a number of countries.\nThe country ranking of well\u2010being is a subject that has attracted a huge amount of\n               interest, in both academic research and the popular press. Helliwell and Wang (\n2012\n) analyse data from the Gallup World Poll and produce a wide variety of country rankings.\n               The results for the Cantril ladder and life satisfaction broadly have OECD countries\n               (and especially Scandinavian countries) towards the top of the world ranking (although\n               both Japan and South Korea lag notably behind other OECD countries in this respect),\n               and poorer African countries towards the bottom. This country ranking is not identical\n               for different subjective well\u2010being measures. Asian countries do rather better on\n               happiness measures, and South American countries are more highly\u2010ranked when the outcome\n               is instead positive affect.\nWith respect to race, there is an established Black\u2010White well\u2010being gap in the US,\n               which seems to be shrinking over time (Stevenson and Wolfers,\n2008\n). Deaton and Stone (\n2016\n) also find a race difference in GHWBI data, with Blacks reporting lower Cantril ladder\n               scores than Whites or Others.\n6\nOther individual characteristics do change within individuals over time, such as income\n               and labor\u2010market status as discussed above. Without going into an extensive list of\n               these characteristics, we finish this subsection by considering three individual characteristics\n               that have attracted empirical attention: health, family life and education.\nThe first of these is the most problematic. It is very commonplace to find that health\n               and life satisfaction, for example, are correlated. However, health is very often\n               measured in surveys via a self\u2010report question.\n7\nAs such, both health and life satisfaction are contemporaneous subjective reports\n               that are potentially contaminated by common mood effects (or any other hidden common\n               factor that affects both reported health and well\u2010being). Research has avoided this\n               pitfall by using more objective measures of health, such as the number of health problems\n               that the individual experiences (with respect to sight, hearing, chest, heart etc.),\n               disability, the number of doctor visits over the past year, and the number of days\n               spent in hospital over the past year. The results continue to show a positive correlation\n               between health and subjective well\u2010being.\nMarital status is systematically correlated with well\u2010being. The married declare higher\n               levels of satisfaction and happiness than do the single, or the divorced, separated\n               or widowed. Marriage is of course an individual choice, and finding that the married\n               are happier than the single could either show that marriage brings about well\u2010being,\n               or that it is \u201chappy types\u201d who are more likely to become married in the first place.\n               An analogous argument can be made for individuals who divorce. The use of panel data\n               can help us to evaluate selection into marital status as a function of subjective\n               well\u2010being. Stutzer and Frey (\n2006\n) analyze this question using SOEP data, and find that the well\u2010being differential\n               associated with marriage is indeed more due to those who were happier when single\n               being more likely to become married in the future.\nPerhaps even more than marital status itself, the relationship between children and\n               well\u2010being has produced a wide variety of diverse findings. Cetre\net al\n. (\n2016\n) consider data from the Gallup World Poll, the European Social Survey (ESS), and\n               the SOEP. They conclude that the relationship between children and happiness differs\n               sharply across countries and populations. In particular, this correlation depends\n               on income, and turns from negative to positive at a GDP level of around 20 000 US\n               Dollars, and on age, being more positive for older adults. Using the panel SOEP data,\n               and following the same kind of approach as used by Stutzer and Frey (\n2006\n) for marital status above, it is shown that (prior to any fertility) individuals\n               who will later become parents report higher levels of life satisfaction than do those\n               who will never have children.\nThe existing work on education has produced a mixed bag of findings. How can this\n               be the case when one of the staple findings in labor economics is that education produces\n               greater earnings (and income is positively correlated with subjective well\u2010being)?\n               One first point is that education may not only raise incomes, but also raise expectations\n               in general about the kind of job or life that the individual believes that they should\n               have:\n8\nin this case the net effect of education on happiness will depend on the rise in\n               outcomes relative to that in expectations. Education is also an individual choice\n               variable, and it is entirely possible that happier people (say) decide to obtain more\n               education. The ideal experiment here would be to randomly allocate education across\n               individuals, and then look at their subjective well\u2010being: this would reveal the causal\n               effect of education.\n9\nVarious reforms have indeed changed access to education for certain groups: for example,\n               the GI Bill in the US and the raising of the compulsory minimum school leaving age\n               in a number of countries. Oreopoulos and Salvanes (\n2011\n) find that a later school\u2010leaving age increased both the income and the well\u2010being\n               of those affected by the change.\n10\nAggregate Characteristics\nAs well as their own individual characteristics, subjective well\u2010being is systematically\n               linked to the aggregate characteristics of the society in which they live. Perhaps\n               the first of these latter to be systematically investigated was GDP per capita. While\n               Easterlin (\n1974\n) found only a weak relationship between well\u2010being and per capita income (based only\n               on a small number of countries), this conclusion has been strengthened in more recent\n               data. In Table 3.1 of Layard\net al\n. (\n2012\n), GDP per capita explains 65 percent of the cross\u2010country variation in the Cantril\n               ladder in the Gallup World Poll.\nThe discussion in Section\n2.1\nabove noted that individual unemployment was associated with sharply lower levels\n               of well\u2010being. But what about the aggregate unemployment rate? This is typically found\n               also to be negatively correlated with happiness: one well\u2010known contribution in this\n               respect is Di Tella\net al\n. (\n2001\n), who use information from the Eurobarometer. Di Tella\net al\n. not only correlate country\u2010level life satisfaction with the unemployment rate, they\n               also consider the country inflation rate at the same time. The inflation rate is of\n               course a purely aggregate phenomenon. The comparison of the estimated coefficients\n               on aggregate unemployment and aggregate inflation allows us to calculate a trade\u2010off\n               between the two: How much more unemployment would individuals be ready to accept (in\n               the sense of remaining at the same level of life satisfaction) in order to reduce\n               inflation by one percentage point?\n11\nOne standard measure of an economy's health is the misery or Okun index, defined\n               as the sum of the unemployment and inflation rates. The results in Di Tella\net al\n. reveal that this assumption of equal weighting is not borne out by the data. In\n               their life\u2010satisfaction regressions, the estimated coefficient on unemployment is\n               over twice as large as that on inflation: at the country level, one point of unemployment\n               affects subjective well\u2010being more than does one point of inflation, which is surely\n               a piece of information that can be used to guide macroeconomic policy. This conclusion\n               is confirmed in a recent update of the analysis using newer Eurobarometer data by\n               Bell\net al\n. (\n2014\n).\nAs well as the level of income (in the region, or country or whatever), we may also\n               be interested in its distribution. The question of the relationship between inequality\n               and happiness has by now produced quite a number of papers. This research area is\n               surveyed in Clark and D'Ambrosio (\n2015\n). Although it may seem natural to think that individuals dislike inequality, there\n               are a number of qualifications that can be made to this simple statement (regarding\n               inequality as an indicator of my own future opportunities, deserved versus undeserved\n               inequality, perceived versus actual inequality, and the role of individual comparisons\n               to others' incomes, as in Section\n2.3\nbelow). Perhaps unsurprisingly in this light, the empirical literature on the link\n               between happiness and inequality has come up with a wide variety of findings: in Table\n               13.1 of Clark and D'Ambrosio (\n2015\n) only around half of the 30 or so listed contributions suggest a negative relationship.\n               There is obviously still much to learn here.\nOther work has looked at the effect of the environment, considering climate, green\n               spaces and pollution. There are by now a number of carefully\u2010crafted pieces of work\n               showing that pollution reduces life satisfaction: two examples are Van Praag and Barsma\n               (\n2005\n) with respect to aircraft noise, and Luechinger (\n2009\n) regarding air pollution. Green spaces and amenities in general raise the well\u2010being\n               of those who can access them: see Ferreira and Moro (\n2010\n), Ferrer\u2010i\u2010Carbonell and Gowdy (\n2007\n), Lora (\n2008\n) and Krekel\net al\n. (\n2016\n). Rehdanz and Maddison (\n2005\n) consider the role of climate, and in particular temperature and precipitation. All\n               of these variables are potential policy targets. Public intervention can and has changed\n               the distribution of green spaces and environmental pollution. Although less directly\n               accessible, climate change is one of this century's key challenges, and Rehdanz and\n               Maddison (\n2005\n) specifically speculate on how climate change might affect subjective well\u2010being.\nThe relationship between government in general and subjective well\u2010being has also\n               attracted attention. Research here has considered, amongst others, the size of government\n               in general (Bj\u00f8rnskov\net al\n.,\n2007\nand Flavin\net al\n.,\n2014\n), the quality of government (Helliwell and Huang,\n2008\n), direct democracy (Frey and Stutzer,\n2000\nand Fl\u00e8che,\n2015\n), the government's welfare\u2010state position (Pacek and Radcliff,\n2008\n), and its position relative to the progressivity of taxation (Oishi\net al\n., 2014). Research into some institutions such as trade\u2010unionism has revealed correlations\n               with subjective well\u2010being both at the macro (Flavin\net al\n.,\n2010\n) and at the individual (union\u2010membership) levels (Bryson\net al\n.,\n2004\n).\nSome contextual variables result directly from what other people do. We can here consider\n               for example crime, trust, corruption and altruism. Many of these are measured in the\n               World Values Survey: Trust (\u201c\nIn general, do you think that most people can be trusted, or alternatively that you\n                  can't be too careful in dealing with people?\n\u201d), Altruism (\u201c\nHave you donated money to a charity in the present month?\n\u201d) and Social Support (\u201c\nIf you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help\n                  you whenever you need them?\n\u201d). Helliwell\net al\n. (\n2018\n) uncover a strong relationship between trust and well\u2010being, suggesting that a movement\n               from the lowest to the highest level of trust is worth one point on the 0\u201310 life\n               satisfaction scale, which is a large effect. Generosity, as measured by charitable\n               giving, is also correlated with well\u2010being. While it is undeniably pleasant to be\n               surrounded by generous people, there is also intriguing work suggesting that altruism\n               raises the well\u2010being of those who are doing the giving (see Aknin\net al\n.,\n2013\nand Dunn\net al\n.,\n2008\n). Last, social support has been shown to be important in World Values Survey data:\n               societies where everyone has someone to rely on are predicted to have life satisfaction\n               scores that are two points higher than a society where no\u2010one has anyone to rely on.\nOf course, not all the behaviors that others engage in are positive: one obvious example\n               is crime. The local quarterly crime rate in the local Police Force Area has been shown\n               to reduce individual mental health in BHPS data (Dustmann and Fasani,\n2016\n).\n12\nOne salient point to be raised here is that the largest effect of crime on well\u2010being\n               may not transit through actually being a victim of crime, but rather via the fear\n               of becoming a future victim of crime (see Moore and Shepherd,\n2007\n).\n13\nOne recent example of empirical analysis that attempts to introduce a number of these\n               different types of aggregate variables at the same time is provided in Table 3.1 of\n               Layard\net al\n. (\n2012\n). This analyzes the relationship between country\u2010level life satisfaction and measures\n               of social support, freedom, corruption, healthy life expectancy, education and income,\n               all at the aggregate level, and the proportion of individuals who are separated, divorced\n               or widowed. The data here is from the Gallup World Poll, and the well\u2010being measures\n               are the Cantril ladder, positive affect and negative affect. The results for the Cantril\n               ladder show significant relationships with income, health and social support (of around\n               the same size) and smaller, but still significant, relationships with freedom and\n               corruption. Marital status and education are not significant in these regressions.\n               The positive and negative affect analysis reveals a role for social support, freedom\n               and corruption: GDP per capita is not significant here (see also Kahneman and Deaton\n               (\n2010\n) for a stronger relationship, using individual\u2010level Gallup data, between income\n               and the Cantril ladder than between income and affect).\nThe past two sub\u2010sections have underlined that both individual and societal characteristics\n               are correlated with subjective well\u2010being. Many will argue that the ultimate aim of\n               studying individual well\u2010being is to help design policies (at the individual or more\n               aggregate level) that will produce greater well\u2010being. To what extent can we use the\n               findings above to guide well\u2010being policy?\nThere are in particular two phenomena which may prevent these correlations from being\n               a useful guide to societal welfare maximization. The first of these is adaptation:\n               a certain individual or societal characteristic may be welcome in the short run, but\n               in the longer run we become used to the goods or the state in question. Some of the\n               well\u2010being effects outlined above may then be only temporary in nature. Second, some\n               behaviors may raise the well\u2010being of the individual concerned, but reduce the well\u2010being\n               of others. A very obvious example is crime, but we will argue below that this phenomenon\n               may in fact be widespread. The positive effects of my behavior on my own well\u2010being\n               may be entirely wiped out by negative effects on others' well\u2010being. Again, looking\n               at the correlation between my own characteristics and my well\u2010being only will be a\n               poor guide to policy for societal well\u2010being. Man is not an island, and what other\n               people do is essential for individual well\u2010being (see Clark,\n2016c\n).\nSocial Comparisons\nSections 2.1 and 2.2 considered individual and aggregate characteristics respectively.\n               Some of the characteristics are both individual and aggregate, with the aggregate\n               figure (the regional unemployment rate, country GDP per capita) being the sum of the\n               individual\u2010level values. We may wonder how these two levels interact. By far the most\u2010often\n               analyzed characteristic in this respect has been income. While richer countries are\n               happier than poorer countries as a rule, how is the effect of one's own income moderated\n               by income at a more aggregate level? In other words, is a real annual income of $40\n               000 per year just as satisfying in Korea as it would be in a country with significantly\n               lower GDP per capita?\nThe subject of relative income, or income comparisons, was considered at length in\n               Clark\net al\n. (\n2008a\n). The broad idea here is that subjective well\u2010being (W) is affected positively by\n               own income (Y), but negatively by the income of some reference group (Y*):\n14\n(1)\nIn equation\n1\n, individuals are happier when they earn more, but less happy as others earn more.\n               This is most often suggested to reflect social status, envy or some similar phenomenon.\n               Note that Section\n2.1\ndiscussed the relationship between individual income and subjective well\u2010being. But\n               it is not enough to know this relationship to make good policy: we need to know how\n               the individual's income affects the well\u2010being of others as well.\nThere is by now a very substantial literature that has used a variety of approaches\n               to show that individuals do have well\u2010being functions of this type. In terms of observed\n               behavior, there is large literature on conspicuous consumption (whereby individuals\n               gain status from having more of a particular good than do others). Conspicuous consumption\n               is by nature comparative: you can only be conspicuous relative to what others are\n               doing. A couple of empirical examples are Bloch\net al\n. (\n2004\n) and Brown\net al\n. (\n2011\n).\nAlternatively, it can be shown directly that measures of individual well\u2010being are\n               negatively correlated with measures of\nY*\n. For example, Clark and Oswald (\n1996\n) analyze BHPS data and show that the job satisfaction of British employees rises\n               with the individual's own income, but falls with the income of the peer group (other\n               people with the same job and demographic characteristics) rises. Clark (\n1996a\n) carries out the same type of analysis, but with the comparison being the partner's\n               income. Luttmer (\n2005\n) is a careful attempt using American data to measure comparisons to those who live\n               close to the individual; see also Ferrer\u2010i\u2010Carbonell (\n2005\n) using German data. Bellet (\n2017\n) is related here, as it considers a measure of wealth, housing, rather than income.\n               Bellet uses American Housing Survey data to show that housing satisfaction is positively\n               correlated with the size of one's own house, but negatively correlated with the size\n               of the houses that have been built in the county since the household moved in: this\n               in particular applies to the average size of all houses bigger than the household's\n               own house, and the average size of the biggest ten percent of houses (see his Table\n               1).\nIncome comparisons have also been analyzed using questions on how much money you would\n               need to reach a certain level of well\u2010being (the Leyden \u201cWelfare Function of Income\u201d:\n               see Van de Stadt\net al\n.,\n1985\n), experimental data (Zizzo and Oswald,\n2001\nand Abbink\net al\n.,\n2009\n), questions on preferences over hypothetical outcomes (Alpizar\net al\n.,\n2005\n; Solnick and Hemenway,\n2005\n), and neurological evidence from brain activity in situations where social comparisons\n               are salient (Flie\u00dfbach\net al\n.,\n2007\n).\nThe conclusion from this work is that well\u2010being is at least partly comparative in\n               income. This is one explanation of the Easterlin Paradox (Easterlin,\n1974\n). If we consider\nY*\nto be the country's GDP per capita, then at any point in time richer individuals\n               will be happier than poorer individuals (holding\nY*\nconstant in equation\n1\n, individual well\u2010being rises in income). But as everyone becomes richer, both\nY\nand\nY*\nrise, and their effects potentially cancel each other out. Higher GDP per capita\n               will then not be accompanied by greater happiness. Easterlin (\n2017\n) is a recent discussion.\nWhile income comparisons have attracted the most attention in this literature, the\n               variable\nY\nin equation\n1\ncan refer to outcomes in many different life domains. In Economics, the relationship\n               between unemployment and individual well\u2010being has figured regularly. The question\n               of social comparisons over unemployment was addressed in Clark (\n2003\n) using BHPS data. The well\u2010being effect of unemployment is context\u2010dependent, with\n               own unemployment having a smaller effect on well\u2010being in higher\u2010unemployment regions\n               and in higher\u2010unemployment households. The surprising finding that unemployment matters\n               less in well\u2010being terms when it is shared with others is in line with research on\n               suicide and para\u2010suicide rates by the unemployed, which are highest in low\u2010unemployment\n               regions (Platt\net al\n.,\n1992\n).\nResearch on individual health status has also shown evidence of comparisons. Blanchflower\net al\n. (\n2009\n) find that self\u2010reports of being overweight rise with own Body Mass Index (BMI),\n               but fall with the average BMI of the reference group (defined as country*age group*sex\n               cells) in Eurobarometer data. Carrieri and de Paola (\n2012\n) present analogous findings for well\u2010being and height in Italian cross\u2010section data.\n               For a given level of own height, those who are taller than the average of their peer\n               group (at the region*age*sex level) report higher levels of well\u2010being. Clark and\n               Etil\u00e9 (\n2011\n) also consider BMI, but with the comparison being to the partner. The analysis of\n               SOEP data reveals that (as is standard) at least after a certain point own BMI and\n               well\u2010being are negatively related. However, the strength of this relationship is moderated\n               by partner's BMI. In particular, the negative effect of own obesity on well\u2010being\n               is smaller when one's partner is either overweight or obese.\nSimilar kinds of social\u2010context effects on well\u2010being have been uncovered in the domains\n               of education (Nikolaev,\n2016\n) and religion (Clark and Lelkes,\n2009\n). In general, it seems that there is much more work that can be done to uncover the\n               effects of social comparisons in the determination of subjective well\u2010being.\nAdaptation\nWe now turn to adaptation. The correlations described in Sections\n2.1\nand\n2.2\n. above were contemporaneous. But for policy purposes, we need to know if these effects\n               will fade away in the longer\u2010run. A recent survey of this area is Clark (\n2016b\n). Note that adaptation is just a particular kind of comparison, as in equation\n1\n, where the reference group is now not other people but rather the individual himself\n               or herself in the past.\nIn terms of comparisons to income, today's income is evaluated in terms of how much\n               I used to earn in the past. My own past good fortune then reduces my current well\u2010being.\n               Clark (\n1999\n) used BHPS panel data to define\nY*\nas the income of the same individual in the same job one year earlier, and found\n               that own past earnings are indeed negatively correlated with current job satisfaction.\n               Similar results have been obtained in SOEP panel data: see for example Grund and Sliwka\n               (\n2007\n), Di Tella\net al\n. (\n2010\n) and Vendrik (\n2013\n). The finding of a negative relationship between past income and current subjective\n               well\u2010being, conditional on the level of own income, is synonymous with individuals\n               adapting to higher incomes.\nAs for the discussion of social comparisons in Section\n2.3\n, there are a number of \u201cnon\u2010happiness\u201d ways of looking at adaptation to income. Work\n               on the Leyden Welfare Function of Income has shown that individuals who earned more\n               in the past say that they require a higher level of income today in order to be satisfied.\n15\nIt is also possible to use information on observed behavior to look for evidence\n               of income adaptation. This has been carried out with experiments on revealed preferences\n               over hypothetical income profiles (Loewenstein and Sicherman,\n1991\nand Frank and Hutchens,\n1993\n), and the analysis of survey data on labour supply (Hotz\net al\n., 1988).\nIf individuals adapt to income, then the well\u2010being response to higher income will\n               be only temporary, as in Figure\n1\nbelow.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nHappiness Adaptation following an Income Shock [Colour figure can be viewed at\nwileyonlinelibrary.com\n]\nSource\n: Clark (\n2016b\n).\nCaption\nHappiness Adaptation following an Income Shock [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]\n                           Source: Clark ().\nIn Figure\n1\n, a permanent rise in income at the end of year 2 produces a contemporaneous rise\n               in well\u2010being. But this effect does not last, with well\u2010being progressively dropping\n               back down to its pre income\u2010rise level. As in Section\n2.3\nabove, we might wonder whether the same phenomenon of adaptation is found in other\n               life domains. This work has been carried out for the labour market, marital status,\n               children, and health in particular. The analysis of adaptation to unemployment, for\n               example, consists in following the same individual in panel data before and after\n               they enter unemployment. Of key interest here is whether the pattern of well\u2010being\n               while the individual remains unemployed shows evidence of adaptation (by first dropping\n               and then bouncing back).\nFigure\n2\nbelow illustrates the adaptation results for five life events (unemployment, marriage,\n               divorce, birth of child, and widowhood) in BHPS data from Clark and Georgellis (\n2013\n). The results here are similar to those in the SOEP (Clark\net al\n.,\n2008b\n) and in other panel datasets (as surveyed in Clark,\n2016b\n). Unemployment stands out here as being a status to which individuals do not adapt.\n               On the contrary, there is evidence of fairly complete adaptation to all of marriage,\n               children, divorce and widowhood.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nAdaptation to life events in the BHPS\nNotes\n: X, \u0394 and \u25a1 denote significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent and 10 percent levels\n                           respectively; the error bars represent the 95 percent confidence intervals.

[Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]\nWhile Figure\n2\n(and work on other panel datasets besides) concludes for only a temporary well\u2010being\n               impact of marriage, in most of the countries analyzed marriage is preceded by a number\n               of years of being in a couple. When we instead apply the same analysis technique to\n               becoming a couple (i.e. entering a relationship), we instead find only partial or\n               no adaptation in BHPS, SOEP and Australian HILDA data (see Chapter 5 of Clark\net al\n.,\n2018\n).\nThere is still much work to be done in the area of well\u2010being adaptation using large\u2010scale\n               panel datasets. The evidence so far suggests that adaptation is not a universal truth.\n               As can be seen in Figure\n2\n, unemployment is an outlier in terms of the events considered there. But it is not\n               the only one. Some of the work cited in Clark (\n2016b\n) concludes as to partial or no adaptation to disability, cosmetic surgery and job\n               insecurity (but full adaptation to moving house and becoming self\u2010employed). In addition,\n               although there is evidence for adaptation to income in general, Clark\net al\n. (\n2016b\n) use SOEP data to show that individuals do not adapt to entry into poverty (and indeed\n               do not adapt to drops in income in general). This underlies that there might be different\n               well\u2010being effects according to the direction of the change that we identify in panel\n               data, which is one of the frontlines of research that I will consider in Section\n5\nbelow.\nWhat do Happy People do?\nThe literature on the determinants of happiness has been growing fast. But so has\n            that on the consequences of well\u2010being. This literature has is in part been carried\n            out with the validation of subjective well\u2010being data in mind. One common objection\n            to the use of such data is exactly that they are subjective. However, if happier people\n            can be shown to be more likely to have some objective outcome in the future, then\n            there must be some \u201creal\u201d information in the subjective well\u2010being scores that different\n            individuals report. The advantage of using subjective data to predict future observable\n            outcomes is that economists have traditionally been more comfortable with objective\n            measures of behavior (what people do) than with subjective evaluations (what people\n            say).\nSection 2.1 above asked whether income buys happiness; we can also ask the reverse\n            question of whether happy people earn more. Well\u2010being has been shown to increase\n            productivity (Oswald\net al\n.,\n2015\n), and to help predict future earnings (De Neve\net al\n.,\n2013\n). In Fl\u00e8che (\n2017\n), teacher satisfaction predicts pupil value\u2010added in Maths: as such, satisfaction\n            can not only affect the individual's own outcomes, but also those of others. Workers\n            with higher well\u2010being scores have been shown to be less likely to quit their jobs\n            (Freeman,\n1978\nwas an early contribution here) and less likely to retire (Clark\net al\n.,\n2015c\n).\nIndividuals with higher well\u2010being scores also have better health outcomes. One famous\n            contribution here is the \u201cNun Study,\u201d in which nuns who wrote more positive short\n            descriptions of their life in their late teens and early twenties were significantly\n            more likely to still be alive 60 years later (Danner\net al\n.,\n2001\n). Banks\net al\n. (\n2012\n) find large\u2010scale equivalent findings relating measures of well\u2010being to survival\n            probabilities six years later in English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing data. In Diener\n            and Chan (\n2011\n), happier people are shown to have stronger immune systems, experience less inflammation\n            and cardiovascular disease and suffer from fewer infections. They also suffer from\n            less telomere shortening (see Epel,\n2009\n).\nTurning to marriage and the family, as noted in Section\n2.1\nabove, happiness scores help to predict future marriage. Along the same lines, in\n            SOEP data lower levels of life satisfaction predict future divorce or separation (Clark\net al\n.,\n2008b\n) and future fertility (Cetre\net al\n.,\n2016\n).\nSo being happy is good for you. And it may also be good for other people around you.\n            Leaving to one side the vexed question of whether happiness is contagious, it has\n            been shown that subjective well\u2010being helps predict social behaviors that others value.\n            As noted in Section\n2.2\n, individuals with higher (previously\u2010elicited) happiness scores are subsequently\n            more generous when deciding how much money to give to others; equally, Thoits and\n            Hewitt (\n2001\n) suggest that happier individuals volunteer more. Flavin and Keane (\n2012\n) underline a relationship between subjective well\u2010being and political participation.\n            Two recent contributions in this domain are Liberini\net al\n. (\n2017\n), who find that life satisfaction predicts political support for the incumbent government\n            in BHPS data (even controlling for income and the change in the financial situation),\n            and Ward (\n2017\n), who uses 40 years of Eurobarometer data covering 15 European countries to show\n            that life satisfaction is a stronger predictor of incumbent vote share than are economic\n            growth, unemployment and inflation. Last, De Neve\net al\n. (\n2013\n) note that happier people are in general more cooperative and more sociable.\nThe mirror image of this correlation is that those with lower well\u2010being are more\n            likely to engage in activities that hurt others. Layard\net al\n. (\n2014\n) find that average childhood emotional health over the ages 5 to 16 predicts (negatively)\n            the number of adult crimes between the ages of 16 and 34 in British Cohort Study data.\nSome Uses of Well\u2010Being Data\nThe previous two sections have addressed the key questions of what determines happiness,\n            and what does happiness predict. In addition to these central issues, subjective well\u2010being\n            has been exceedingly useful in providing estimates of economic magnitudes that are\n            difficult or impossible to obtain from other sources.\nPreferences are not absolute. It is not helpful to say \u201c\nI like X\n\u201d or \u201c\nI like Y very much\n.\u201d In a world of constrained maximisation, we need to know how much you would be willing\n            to give up to have one unit more of\nX\nor\nY\n. Were we to be able to observe some cardinal measure of utility, then we could say\n            (for example) that one more hour of leisure is worth some number of utils. But many\n            people don't think of utils as a natural unit of measure.\n16\nWe often refer to trade\u2010offs in order to quantify preferences: how much money would\n            you give up to have that new car (i.e. What is the car's shadow price)? Or how much\n            extra weekly labour income would you require to work one more hour per week (i.e.\n            What is your shadow wage)?\nInformation on these trade\u2010offs can be obtained from a life\u2010satisfaction equation\n            that is estimated as a function of weekly income (Y), weekly hours of work (h) and\n            a set of other controls,\nX\n:\n(2)\nHere one more hour of work per week would be compensated (in the sense of leaving\n            life satisfaction unchanged) by a rise in weekly labor income of\u2014\u03b2\n2/\n\u03b2\n1\n. Clark (\n1996b\n) was an early attempt at this kind of calculation on data from the first (1991) wave\n            of the BHPS, producing a reasonable\u2010sounding figure of \u00a38.60 per hour.\n17\nA far more recent estimation of this type, appealing to an exogenous movement in\n            hours of work due to the reductions in the standard workweek in France and Portugal,\n            appears in Lepinteur (\n2016\n). The same approach is taken for shorter workweeks in Japan and Korea in Hamermesh\net al\n. (\n2017\n).\nRunning an equation such as\n2\nproduces one estimated coefficient on each variable, and so only one value for the\n            trade\u2010off between two determinants of life satisfaction. If we would instead like\n            to predict why some people act differently from others (i.e. to predict behavior)\n            then we require the trade\u2010offs to be different for across groups of individuals. We\n            will likely never have enough data to estimate\n2\nseparately for each individual, but we can separate individuals up into groups. This\n            can either be done ex ante, by running separate regressions for men and women, or\n            for the older and the younger, or by using latent\u2010class estimation techniques, where\n            a number of different regression lines (and so estimated coefficients) are identified\n            endogenously via maximum likelihood (see Clark\net al\n.,\n2005\n). The findings from the latter kind of estimation have shown that those with a higher\n            estimated marginal utility of income (a higher value of \u03b2\n1\nin equation\n2\nabove) retire from the labour market later (Clark and Fawaz,\n2016\n) and tend to vote more right\u2010wing (Clark and Etil\u00e9,\n2013\n).\nThe estimated trade\u2010offs in subjective well\u2010being equations can be compared to those\n            obtained by other more traditional means. The estimated income\u2010leisure trade\u2010off seem\n            to be similar in subjective well\u2010being equations and standard labor\u2010supply estimation\n            (Akay\net al\n.,\n2015\n). However, Benjamin\net al\n. (\n2014\n) strike a note of caution, as their estimated trade\u2010offs in life\u2010satisfaction equations\n            do not correspond well to the trade\u2010offs that individuals actually make in observed\n            choices.\nSubjective well\u2010being analysis can also inform us about the value of the kinds of\n            aggregate variables discussed in Section\n2.2\nabove. As noted there, Di Tella\net al\n. (\n2001\n) compared the estimated coefficients on unemployment and inflation. We can also compare\n            the estimated coefficient on income to that on a more aggregate variable to calculate\n            the nuisance value of noise pollution (as in Van Praag and Baarsma,\n2005\n) and air pollution, or the value of access to green spaces, for example.\nThe estimated coefficients in well\u2010being equations also contribute to the understanding\n            of choice. One initial vexed question on the labor market concerned the extent of\n            voluntary unemployment (in the aftermath of the huge rise in unemployment following\n            the first and second oil\u2010price shocks in the 1970s). If unemployment is chosen over\n            employment, then it should yield a higher level of well\u2010being. Clark and Oswald (\n1994\n) compared the well\u2010being of the employed to the unemployed in the first wave of the\n            BHPS and found a large gap between unemployment and employment, which is not consistent\n            with unemployment being for the most part a choice. In the same vein, a very well\u2010known\n            contribution by Blanchflower and Oswald (\n1998\n)\n18\nlooked at self\u2010employment versus employment: Is self\u2010employment a choice, or is it\n            rather the last resort of those who cannot find an adequate job? Job\u2010 and life\u2010satisfaction\n            data reveal that the self\u2010employed actually have higher levels of well\u2010being than\n            do the employed. This itself poses a new question: Why are we not all self\u2010employed\n            then, if it is preferable to employment? Blanchflower and Oswald hypothesize that\n            some people would like to become self\u2010employed, but are not able to obtain the necessary\n            capital to do so (as there is asymmetric information, and banks do not necessarily\n            fund all good projects). As a test, the sample is split into those who inherited money\n            and those who did not, with the argument that the former are less likely to be capital\u2010constrained.\n            The satisfaction differential between the employed and the self\u2010employed is large\n            and significant for the latter group, but zero for the former group. In the same way\n            that the unemployed would prefer employment (but can't find a job), some employees\n            would prefer to be self\u2010employed (but cannot obtain the necessary capital to do so).\nThe same kind of analysis of allocation on the labor market can be carried out within\n            employees, looking at public\u2010 versus private\u2010sector jobs (Luechinger\net al\n.,\n2008\n), part\u2010time versus full\u2010time jobs (Booth and Van Ours,\n2008\n), and temporary versus permanent work (Busk\net al\n.,\n2017\n). Moving away from simple binary comparisons of this type, we can consider the choice\n            of different occupations and industries. There has been a huge amount of work in labor\n            economics on wage differentials at this level. Yet there is still no agreement on\n            what these represent: Are they compensating for unobserved job characteristics (as\n            in the theory of compensating differentials), or do they reveal that jobs in some\n            occupations and industries are really more attractive than others (so that the wage\n            differentials reflect rents)? One way of distinguishing between these two explanations\n            is to see whether the observed wage differences map onto observed job\u2010satisfaction\n            differences. Any such mapping will be consistent with wage rents, while the lack of\n            a correlation suggests compensating differentials rather. This is what Clark (\n2003\n) does using BHPS data. There is no correlation between the industry wage and job\n            satisfaction structures; however, there is a strong relationship between the occupation\n            wage and job satisfaction structures. The proposed interpretation is in terms of tournaments.\n            Tournaments involve moving up job ladders (and changing occupation, but not industry),\n            and the \u201cprize\u201d associated with winning the tournament is a wage rent.\nLast, we can consider allocations outside of the labour market, and in particular\n            the attraction of different regions. Oswald and Wu (\n2011\n) show that the pattern of life satisfaction across the States of the US closely matches\n            the associated distribution of objective amenities.\nThese applications of the estimated coefficients in well\u2010being regressions still remain\n            relatively unexplored. Much more work in this area is to be expected.\nCurrent and Future Frontlines\nSince empirical research in subjective well\u2010being in Economics really started to take\n            off in around 2000, there has been a great deal of replication, contention and confirmation,\n            as is normal in pretty much any empirical science. While some results have now entered\n            into well\u2010being lore (relative effects of income, the U\u2010shaped relationship with age),\n            others are much more in the frontline of current research. In addition to the ongoing\n            research mentioned a number of times above, this last section discusses a number of\n            promising research areas, in no particular order.\nA first very general point is that research tends to be rather monolithic in terms\n            of the datasets used, and thus in terms of the populations whose well\u2010being we analyse.\n            It is true that there is cross\u2010country work on the Gallup World Poll and the World\n            Values Survey, but large\u2010scale work using panel data has in the vast majority been\n            reduced to three countries: Australia (HILDA), Germany (SOEP) and the UK (BHPS). This\n            restriction is of course by necessity rather than choice, but we should always be\n            aware of the potential lack of external validity of many of our findings.\nSecond, almost every single well\u2010being paper of the type described in Section\n2\nhas modelled averages. It is undoubtedly true that we care about average well\u2010being\n            in a society, but we probably care about its distribution too: for given average satisfaction,\n            we would prefer the variance of well\u2010being to be lower, as this would imply fewer\n            people with low well\u2010being (and our social\u2010welfare function may put more weight on\n            those in misery than on those with high subjective well\u2010being). There are very few\n            contributions in this sense. One recent one (Clark\net al\n.,\n2016a\n) underlined that the correlates of the mean and variance of well\u2010being may well not\n            be the same. While there has been a lot of work on the potential lack of a relationship\n            between GDP growth and average satisfaction or happiness in a country, GDP growth\n            does seem to be systematically correlated with a lower variance in well\u2010being.\nAnother way of broadening the area of empirical inquiry would be to take quantile\n            effects into account (as in Binder and Coad,\n2011\nand\n2015\n). A variable that is overall uncorrelated with well\u2010being in a regression may instead\n            exhibit a strong correlation at some point of the well\u2010being distribution, making\n            it potentially useful for policy purposes.\nResearch has also been concentrated on the adult determinants of adult subjective\n            well\u2010being. There are at least two possible extensions here. One is to consider the\n            distal (childhood and family) correlates of adult well\u2010being (as in Layard\net al\n.,\n2014\n, and Clark\net al\n.,\n2018\n). The other is to consider childhood well\u2010being as an outcome in its own right. Partly\n            because the childhood we live is part of what makes a good life, and partly because\n            childhood well\u2010being is such a strong predictor of well\u2010being throughout adulthood.\n            The concentration on family and childhood here requires birth\u2010cohort data for the\n            measurement of family background, childhood outcomes, and well\u2010being throughout life.\nThere has not been enough work on the effect of exogenous movements in explanatory\n            variables on well\u2010being. Of course, a number of key variables are exogenous by construction\n            (age, ethnicity and sex) and others seem to pretty much act is if they were (unemployment).\n            Exogenous movements in some others are quite easy to imagine, such as lottery winnings\n            for income (Apouey and Clark,\n2015\nand Gardner and Oswald,\n2007\n), or the minimum school\u2010leaving age for education (Clark and Jung,\n2016\nand Oreopoulos and Salvanes,\n2011\n). However, instruments for other variables are rather more difficult to think of,\n            such as marital status, and children.\n19\nPanel data has greatly advanced our understanding of the causes and consequences of\n            subjective well\u2010being. One obvious contribution has been the ability to control for\n            individual fixed effects, thereby conditioning out any unobserved individual variables\n            that do not vary over time and might be correlated with well\u2010being. One obvious candidate\n            here is reporting style, whereby some individuals tend to use lower numbers to reflect\n            the same latent feelings than do others. Panel data also allows us to correlate current\n            well\u2010being to past values of the explanatory variables. This was behind the analysis\n            of adaptation described in Section 2.4; another application is to consider the role\n            of past completed events on current well\u2010being, such as the scarring effect of past\n            unemployment (Clark\net al\n.,\n2001\nand Knabe and R\u00e4tzel,\n2011\n). To date this kind of dynamic analysis has only been quite simple. Other more complicated\n            analyses are possible, including the use of lagged dependent variables and the introduction\n            of different time profiles of the explanatory variables (such as the order of different\n            past poverty spells in Clark\net al\n.,\n2015a\n).\nThe use of panel data also allows us to consider potential asymmetries in reactions\n            to positive and negative movements. The estimation of fixed\u2010effects models works via\n            comparing intra\u2010individual changes in well\u2010being to the intra\u2010individual changes in\n            the explanatory variables. This estimation is symmetric, in the sense that the same\n            relationship is assumed to hold when the explanatory variable is above the individual\u2010level\n            mean and below the individual\u2010level mean:\n(3)\nIn the case of income, a jump of 1000 Euros above the individual\u2010level mean induces\n            a change in life satisfaction of the same absolute size (we here assume that the dependent\n            variable is life satisfaction and the explanatory variable,\nx\n, is income) as does a drop of 1000 Euros below the individual\u2010level mean: \u03b2. But\n            it is far from clear that this is the case, and loss\u2010aversion would suggest that falls\n            in income produce well\u2010being movements that are larger in size than those from an\n            equivalent rise in income. Some empirical evidence along these lines using SOEP data\n            appears in D'Ambrosio and Frick (\n2012\n) and Boyce\net al\n. (\n2013\n).\nThis asymmetry is not limited to income, or even to cardinal explanatory variables.\n            Considering a binary explanatory variable, labor\u2010force status say, entry into unemployment\n            from employment is assumed to produce the same movement in life satisfaction in absolute\n            value as the inverse switch when the individual exits unemployment to start a new\n            job. In general, much remains to be explored regarding the role of the time profiles\n            of explanatory variables and current subjective well\u2010being.\nThe next two research areas concern the exploration of more unusual data in the context\n            of subjective well\u2010being. There has been only very little work on happiness and brain\n            activity (two examples are Urry\net al\n.,\n2004\nand Fliessbach\net al\n. 2007). Neuro evidence is very valuable here not only for what it tells us about\n            the sources of well\u2010being, but also because it arguably avoids any bias in well\u2010being\n            scores due to the individual reporting function. The well\u2010being measures here come\n            straight from the horse's mouth, as it were.\nThere is great interest in the role of genetics. Are we pre\u2010determined by our genes,\n            including in terms of our subjective well\u2010being? While recent research has identified\n            genes that are correlated with subjective well\u2010being (De Neve\net al\n.,\n2012\n) this does not mean that happiness is pre\u2010determined. Research has underlined the\n            importance of gene\u2010environment interactions. For simplicity, imagine that there are\n            less\u2010favorable and more\u2010favorable genotypes. Individuals with a more\u2010favorable genotype\n            are not susceptible to low well\u2010being; those with the less\u2010favorable genotype are\n            susceptible to low well\u2010being, but only if they experience negative events. Empirical\n            analysis will reveal a correlation between genotype and subjective well\u2010being. But\n            this is not an individual fixed effect: it rather reflects an interaction between\n            genes and the events that befall the individual. In this simple illustration, policy\n            that avoided the occurrence of negative events (perhaps unemployment or poverty) would\n            prevent the less\u2010favorable genotype from playing a role, effectively shutting off\n            any observed relationship between genes and happiness.\n20\nLast, the rise of subjective well\u2010being across the social sciences has been accompanied\n            by an increase in the availability of ways of measuring it. Which way of measuring\n            well\u2010being is the best? There is no simple way of answering this question, but research\n            has shown that life satisfaction, measures of recent positive and negative emotions\n            (or \u201caffect\u201d) and eudaimonic measures (that reflect notions of mastery, relations\n            with others, self\u2010acceptance and purpose) are reasonably similar, especially in terms\n            of how they are related to a standard set of explanatory variables (Clark,\n2016a\n). But they are not the same. It is important to distinguish between affect (how you\n            feel right at this moment: your emotions) and cognitive/evaluative measures such as\n            life satisfaction, which refer to your evaluation of your life overall. We might expect\n            the latter to be some kind of sum of the former, but this does not seem to be the\n            case. This raises the very difficult question of which of affect or life satisfaction\n            we should have as a goal as policy\u2010makers. What matters more: life as you live it\n            day\u2010to\u2010day or moment\u2010to\u2010moment, or life as you remember it? Would you prefer to live\n            a good life, or to remember having lived a good life?\nThere is still a great deal that we do not know about these different measures. For\n            example, the work on social comparisons and adaptation has almost exclusively appealed\n            to information on life satisfaction. But would the same phenomena be revealed were\n            we to consider the emotion of sadness, or Eudaimonia?\nBeyond these correlations, future work may appeal to the ability of measures of subjective\n            well\u2010being to predict behavior, as discussed in Section\n3\nabove. There is however a dearth of research of this type comparing a number of different\n            well\u2010being measures. The fascinating work in Benjamin\net al\n. (\n2012\n) shows that own happiness is not the only factor that predicts individual choice\n            (in hypothetical\u2010choice experiments): there are independent effects of control, purpose,\n            fun and social status. It is worth noting that own happiness is the largest single\n            predictor of choice by far, and that the addition of these non\u2010happiness terms does\n            not improve the predictive power of the equation that much. The search for the \u201cbest\u201d\n            measure of well\u2010being is likely to continue for some time.\nConclusion\nThe remarkable rise of subjective well\u2010being across the social sciences, and in particular\n            Economics, seems to continue apace. Once considered as an intellectual curiosity at\n            best, and most definitely not part of Economics, it has seemingly started to enter\n            the mainstream. Happiness articles appear in the top\u2010ranked journals, and are amongst\n            the best\u2010cited articles published by those journals. Just over 15 years ago, a review\n            article asked \u201cWhat can economists learn from happiness research?\u201d (Frey and Stutzer,\n2002\n). That article is currently the sixth most\u2010cited article ever published in the\nJournal of Economic Literature\n: the answer would then appear to be \u201ca very great deal.\u201d The past four decades of\n            happiness research have been inventive, and to my mind have brought social sciences\n            closer together. The coming decades have every chance of being just as exciting.\nFootnotes\n1\nAs it did in other disciplines too. Diener\net al\n. (2016) note that there were over 14,000 publications in 2015 on subjective well\u2010being\n               (SWB).\n2\nClark and Oswald (\n1994\n), Oswald (\n1997\n), Easterlin (2001) and Ferrer\u2010i\u2010Carbonell and Frijters (2004).\n3\nClark and Oswald (\n1996\n) and Blanchflower and Oswald (\n2004\n).\n4\nThe literature on the individual\u2010level determinants (and some of the aggregate ones)\n               is by now huge, and I will only be able to mention a small number of references here.\n               Longer reviews appear in Dolan\net al\n. (\n2008\n) and Layard\net al\n. (\n2012\n).\n5\nIn which respondents are asked the following question: \u201c\nPlease imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top.\n                  The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of\n                  the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder\n                  would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?\n\u201d\n6\nThey also underline a significant framing effect, with individuals who were first\n               asked about their satisfaction with the way things are going in the US reporting lower\n               individual well\u2010being scores in the next question. This treatment effect is smaller\n               for Blacks than for Whites, and serves to eliminate the Black\u2010White well\u2010being gap\n               (see Figure 1 in Deaton and Stone,\n2016\n).\n7\nFor example, in the BHPS the subjective health question is \u201c\nPlease think back over the last 12 months about how your health has been. Compared\n                  to people of your own age, would you say that your health has on the whole been\n,\u201d with response categories of Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor and Very Poor.\n8\nClark\net al\n. (\n2015b\n) analyse Japanese data and find that education is associated with higher levels of\n               happiness, but also with higher scores on a question asking individuals how happy\n               they believe that they should be.\n9\nWe would also like to do the same thing with respect to marital status, children,\n               income, and so on.\n10\nAlthough Clark and Jung (\n2016\n) cannot replicate the UK results in their analysis of BHPS data, finding a life satisfaction\n               effect that is either zero or negative.\n11\nThis use of subjective well\u2010being regressions to calculate trade\u2010offs is one of the\n               more interesting applications of this new kind of data. It complements existing work\n               that has tried to infer individual preferences via behavior (i.e., revealed preferences)\n               and hypothetical\u2010choice experiments.\n12\nSee also Powdthavee (\n2005\n).\n13\nOf course, the same argument can be made about other life domains as well. While we\n               have highlighted the correlation between being unemployed and subjective well\u2010being,\n               the fear of future unemployment (commonly measured as job insecurity) may be just\n               as important. Equally, the well\u2010being consequences of low income may be paralleled\n               by negative effects from financial insecurity.\n14\nTo carry out empirical analysis here, we do need to know who is in the reference group.\n               The literature has used a number of different plausible definitions: those who have\n               the same characteristics (for example, age, sex and education) as me; others in the\n               same household; friends; neighbours; work colleagues; or even myself in the past.\n               For the last definition, the comparison income level to which I would compare my current\n               income is the income that I have myself earned in the past.\n15\nVan Praag (\n1971\n) calls this \u201cpreference drift:\u201d\n16\nAlthough Clark\net al\n. (\n2018\n) argue that it is becoming more natural to think of life satisfaction on a zero to\n               ten scale as an outcome, so that individuals do have an idea of what one life\u2010satisfaction\n               point represents.\n17\nThis is equivalent to around \u00a317.50 per hour in 2017 prices.\n18\nThis is the most\u2010cited paper ever published in the\nJournal of Labor Economics\n.\n19\nOf course some events are exogenous by nature, and there have been a number of analyses\n               of the well\u2010being consequences of events such as natural disasters (Rehdanz\net al\n.,\n2015\n) and terrorism (Frey\net al\n.,\n2009\n; Metcalfe\net al\n.,\n2011\nand Clark\net al\n.,\n2017\n).\n20\nSee Pluess (\n2015\n) for a recent survey of this fascinating area.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

This paper\n            examines not only the quantity, but also the quality of road infrastructure and, thus,\n            extends existing studies that only consider the benefits of road accessibility. It\n            is found that proximity to main roads may not necessarily result in improved welfare.\n            Instead, ensuring all\u2010weather access to roads appears to be a more significant factor\n            in raising household well\u2010being. Specifically, road accessibility during the rainy\n            season reduces the probability of households reporting a \u2018less than adequate\u2019 (low\n            satisfaction) response by 13\u201325 percent. This suggests that in Timor\u2010Leste, and likely\n            in other developing economies under similar conditions, maintenance of existing roads\n            is more essential to well\u2010being than building more roads.\nI Introduction\nAn efficient and reliable road network that effectively links people, opportunities\n            and markets can place an economy in the fast lane on the road toward development.\n            The ultimate goal of development is to raise the well\u2010being of a society through improvements\n            in social, political and economic conditions. To realize this goal, transport infrastructure\n            investment is among the main government interventions used to underpin a push toward\n            development. The argument rests with a straightforward logic that transportation infrastructure\n            (e.g. roads, railways, seaports and airports) broadens economic opportunities by creating\n            markets, linking factors of production and connecting value chains. Transport infrastructure\n            is also used intensively by all economic groups, resulting in more inclusive economic\n            opportunities stemming from the enhanced mobility of people, production inputs and\n            information when infrastructure is improved. As such, policy is often directed to\n            increase the number of roads. The present study maintains that the rehabilitation\n            of existing roads could also be welfare\u2010enhancing.\nThe present paper is among the very first attempts at empirically investigating the\n            relationship between road access and subjective well\u2010being, using a nationally representative\n            household\u2010level survey from Timor\u2010Leste; namely, the 2007 Timor\u2010Leste Survey of Living\n            Standards (TSLS).\n2\nThe salient feature of our empirical exercise is that the notion of road access has\n            two dimensions: quantity and quality of roads. The former is measured by walk time\n            (minutes) to main roads as in Brereton\net al.\n(\n2008\n), whereas the latter is proxied by whether households have access to roads during\n            the rainy season and, hence, is in the spirit of Dercon\net al.\n(\n2009\n). In contrast to the past studies, we examine various aspects of well\u2010being, including\n            adequacy of food, housing, clothing, healthcare, income and child education, rather\n            than overall life satisfaction. Our empirical framework builds upon the standard model\n            of ordered outcomes in which road access variables, together with other household\u2010specific\n            characteristics, enter the subjective well\u2010being equations. Based on ordered logit\n            and probit estimates, we find robust evidence that proximity to roads may not always\n            enhance subjective well\u2010being. For some aspects like housing and health satisfaction,\n            a shorter walk time to roads leads to inferior well\u2010being, highlighting potentially\n            unfavorable consequences of building more roads. Interestingly, access to roads during\n            the rainy season appears to be a much more significant contributing factor to subjective\n            well\u2010being in all respects. Specifically, the marginal effects indicate that provision\n            of all\u2010weather road accessibility reduces the probability of households reporting\n            a \u2018less than adequate\u2019 response to subjective measures of well\u2010being by approximately\n            13\u201325 percent. Furthermore, all\u2010weather access to roads increases the probability\n            of \u2018just adequate\u2019 and \u2018more than adequate\u2019 responses by 13\u201324 percent and 0.3\u20133.0\n            percent, respectively.\nThere are at least two main contributions of this paper. First, the present paper,\n            to the best of our knowledge, is the first to consider the quality of roads in the\n            relationship between road access and subjective well\u2010being. Second, the findings offer\n            a clearer insight into how transportation infrastructure can be translated into improved\n            well\u2010being and standards of living. In the context of a post\u2010conflict, newly emerging\n            economy like Timor\u2010Leste, the answer to this inquiry is critical because appropriate\n            transport infrastructure development strategies will be an important foundation of\n            national development and improvements in Timorese well\u2010being. Based on our main findings,\n            Timor\u2010Leste is in dire need of better, and not necessarily more, roads. Hence, public\n            investment priorities should be devoted to rehabilitation of existing roads such that\n            they are climate\u2010proof and consistently accessible.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the background of road infrastructure\n            development in Timor\u2010Leste. Section III develops the empirical framework and estimation\n            strategies. Section IV details the data sources and measurement of all variables.\n            Section V presents and analyzes the empirical results and checks the robustness of\n            the model. Section VI concludes.\nII Roles of Road Transport in Timor\u2010Leste\nII. 1 Country context\nTimor\u2010Leste (also known as East Timor) is a small newly\u2010independent nation situated\n               on the eastern half of Timor Island, which it shares with the Indonesian province\n               of East Nusa Tenggara. The country's total land area of less than 15 000\u2009km\n2\nis home to a population of around 1.2 million Timorese.\nFollowing extensive violence and damage during its struggle for independence, Timor\u2010Leste\n               came under the United Nations administration in late 1999 until formal sovereignty\n               was achieved in May 2002. Timor\u2010Leste's brief economic history as an independent state\n               can be separated into two periods, delineated by the 2006 humanitarian and political\n               crisis brought about by escalating conflict among the country's security forces.\nThe first period saw an economy that was supported primarily by development partner\n               assistance focused on the establishment of a fully functioning government, as well\n               as the restoration of basic social services, including education, health and security.\n               GDP contracted by an average of 0.6 percent per annum over the period from 2002 to\n               2005.\n3\nFueled by revenue from offshore petroleum operations, growth accelerated during the\n               period after 2006. From 2007 to 2012, growth averaged 10.6% per annum, with annual\n               petroleum revenues peaking at almost US$4bn by the end of the period, and supporting\n               government expenditures in excess of 100 percent of GDP.\nMiddle\u2010income status was achieved in 2007, and Timor\u2010Leste's Strategic Development\n               Plan 2011\u20132030 outlines a path to the upper\u2013middle income status by 2030 by targeting\n               rapid rates of GDP growth over the long term. Sustaining rapid long\u2010run growth is\n               achievable with sound economic management and favorable external economic conditions.\n               An expanding labor force, potential benefits of education and technology catch\u2010up,\n               and the availability of resources sufficient to fund large public investment underpin\n               this optimism.\n4\nWhile Timor\u2010Leste's first decade of growth has generally been inclusive, the low\n               quality of infrastructure could potentially become a binding constraint to future\n               development. Renewed public investment in lagging sectors (particularly roads and\n               transport infrastructure, as well as water and sanitation) will be crucial to further\n               raise the inclusiveness of growth going forward (Sugden,\n2014\n).\nII. 2 Sector context\nA positive cross\u2010country relationship between transportation infrastructure and economic\n               development is well\u2010established. Countries with well\u2010developed transport infrastructure\n               are typically high\u2010income countries, while underdeveloped transportation infrastructure\n               is ubiquitous in low\u2010income countries. An increasing number of studies are examining\n               the impacts of transportation infrastructure on various development outcomes. For\n               instance, Banerjee\net al.\n(\n2012\n) show a moderately positive impact of access to transportation networks on GDP per\n               capita in China PRC and underline factor mobility as a catalyst of economic development.\n               Dercon\net al.\n(\n2009\n) investigate the effects of public investment that leads to better quality of roads\n               on consumption and poverty in rural Ethiopia. Their estimates show that all\u2010weather\n               roads reduce poverty by 6.9 percentage points and increase consumption growth by 16.3\n               percentage points. Glaeser and Gottlieb (\n2009\n) contemplate the distributional effects of transport infrastructure across urban\u2013rural\n               areas in the USA and posit that rural areas tend to be excluded from the benefits\n               of transportation infrastructure investment.\nThe links between transportation infrastructure and a wide array of development outcomes\n               are well\u2010established in the literature. However, a largely unexplored aspect is the\n               impact of improved transportation infrastructure on the population's well\u2010being: the\n               ultimate development agenda. Among the very few studies that touch upon a nexus between\n               transportation infrastructure and life satisfaction is Brereton\net al.\n(\n2008\n). They employ the geographic information system (GIS) to empirically explore the\n               linkage between proximity to facilities (e.g. airports, rail stations and major roads)\n               and overall life satisfaction. They find that while proximity to airports is positively\n               correlated with life satisfaction, the opposite results hold for proximity to roads.\n               In addition, the relationship appears to be insignificant for proximity to rail stations.\n               It should be noted, nonetheless, that Brereton\net al.\n(\n2008\n) confine the notion of transportation infrastructure to proximity to facilities and\n               do not capture the \u2018quality\u2019 of transportation infrastructure.\nA study of how transport infrastructure enhances people's welfare and offers the impetus\n               for economic development in Timor\u2010Leste is motivating in its own right. For Timor\u2010Leste,\n               a post\u2010conflict country that regained its independence in 2002, one of the biggest\n               challenges concerns transforming the nation's natural resources (mostly offshore petroleum)\n               into social and economic development for its 1.12 million people (ADB (Asian Development\n               Bank),\n2011a\n). To achieve this, the Government of Timor\u2010Leste and its development partners acknowledge\n               that improving infrastructure, especially the road transport system, is of overarching\n               importance to all sectors of the economy and society. Road development is critical\n               to fostering private sector growth, improving agricultural productivity, reducing\n               poverty, promoting investment and human development, and strengthening the capacity\n               to deliver social services (Gajewski\net al.,\n2007\n). The road sector serves as the dominant mode of transport in Timor\u2010Leste, given\n               the underdeveloped domestic civil aviation, limited sea transport and impossibility\n               of river transport.\nWhile road transport has been part and parcel of people's livelihood, the state of\n               road development is poor. In 2008, only 8 percent of the entire core road network\n               spanning 2300\u2009km was in fair condition, with 22 percent in poor and 70 percent in\n               very poor condition (ADB (Asian Development Bank),\n2011b\n).\n5\nFigure\n1\nillustrates the road condition along the Dili\u2010Baucau national roads during the rainy\n               season. Frequent landslides, road closures due to intense rainfall and geotechnical\n               instability in mountainous areas exacerbate the situation. Roads are often inaccessible,\n               especially during the rainy season. As roads become unreachable or unusable, food,\n               medical supplies and basic necessities cannot be delivered to meet households\u2019 needs;\n               students cannot go to school and absence from work shuts off main income sources among\n               workers and their families. As such, road development must focus not only on expanding\n               the road network, but also on maintaining all\u2010weather accessibility to address the\n               most critical binding constraint to inclusive development in Timor\u2010Leste.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nRoads after rains in Timor\u2010Leste.\nCaption\nRoads after rains in Timor\u2010Leste.\nFigure\n2\nshows average walk time to main roads vis\u2010\u00e0\u2010vis different levels of subjective well\u2010being,\n               based on our household\u2010level dataset.\n6\nIt should be highlighted that, based on our dataset, subjective well\u2010being reflects\n               the adequacy of various dimensions related to households\u2019 basic needs, including food,\n               housing, clothing, healthcare, income and child education. It can be observed from\n               Figure\n2\nthat shorter distances to main roads are associated with higher levels of subjective\n               well\u2010being; in other words, households closer to road networks tend to report adequate\n               or more than adequate basic necessities. The positive relationship between proximity\n               to road networks and subjective well\u2010being holds in almost all dimensions of basic\n               necessities. The only exception is in distances to main roads and concerns over housing.\n               Households that reported housing is more than adequate tend to have an average walk\n               time to roads of approximately 21\u2009min: higher than the averages of 10 and 7\u2009min for\n               those reporting \u2018less than adequate\u2019 and \u2018just adequate\u2019 housing, respectively. Intuitively,\n               this is understandable given the fact that housing further away from main roads is\n               more affordable than that closer to main roads.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nHouseholds\u2019 subjective well\u2010being and average walk time to the nearest roads.\nCaption\nHouseholds\u2019 subjective well\u2010being and average walk time to the nearest roads.\nFigure\n3\nsheds some light on whether road accessibility during the rainy season matters to\n               households\u2019 standards of living. It depicts the proportion of households reporting\n               that roads remain accessible during the rainy season across different levels of subjective\n               well\u2010being. It can be distinctly discerned that households with access to roads even\n               during the rainy season generally report higher levels of subjective well\u2010being across\n               all dimensions. Strikingly, all households reporting that their food, clothing, healthcare,\n               income and child education are \u2018more than adequate\u2019 have access to roads during the\n               rainy season.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nProportion of households reporting that roads are accessible during rainy season across\n                        levels of subjective well\u2010being.\nCaption\nProportion of households reporting that roads are accessible during rainy season across\n                           levels of subjective well\u2010being.\nIn summary, this section presents a preliminary picture that road infrastructure development\n               may be instrumental to raising households\u2019 living standards in Timor\u2010Leste. Therefore,\n               it is interesting to develop an in\u2010depth empirical analysis of whether, and to what\n               extent, road transport helps support households\u2019 subjective well\u2010being. The ensuing\n               discussions in this paper are dedicated to answering these research inquiries.\nIII The Model\nWe employ the standard approach to modelling subjective well\u2010being. It builds upon\n            the following indirect utility function:\n(1)\nwhere Ui is a utility level of household\ni\n=\u20091,\u2009\u2026,\nn\n; and\n\u03b2\nand\n\u03b3\nare vectors of estimated coefficients.\nX\ni\nis a vector of control variables representing road infrastructure available to household\n            i and, thus, is central to our analysis.\nZ\ni\nis a vector of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, such as consumption\n            expenditure, economic status and location. These household\u2010specific attributes follow\n            the conventional determinants of subjective well\u2010being as in Clark and Oswald (\n1994\n); Easterlin (\n1995\n); Ferrer\u2010i\u2010Carbonell and Frijters (\n2004\n); Blanchflower and Oswald (\n1994\n); Stutzer (\n2004\n) and, more recently, Chongvilaivan and Powdthavee (\n2014\n).\nBecause household i's utility level is not observable, the conventional empirical\n            strategy is to employ self\u2010reported subjective well\u2010being (Frey and Stutzer,\n1999\n).\n7\nEquation\n1\nis, therefore, modeled by using the ordered probit formulation (Aitchinson and Silvey,\n1957\n) and can be rewritten as:\n(2)\nwhere\nj\n=\u20091,\u2009\u2026,\nJ\n. The dependent variable\nLS\ni\n\u2208\u2009{1,\u2009\u2026,\nJ\n} represents a self\u2010reported level of satisfaction in response to a subjective well\u2010being\n            question for household i.\n\u03c9\nj\nand\n\u03c9\nj\n\u2212\u20091\ndenote latent variables representing the threshold values for a satisfaction level\n            j. \u03a6(\u2022) is the cumulative density function, where its variance, without loss of generality,\n            is normalized to unity, and a zero intercept is imposed for identification. To ensure\n            that \u03a6(\u2022) is well behaved, we impose an assumption that \u03a6(\n\u03c9\n0\n\u2212\n\u03b2\n\u2032\nX\ni\n\u2212\n\u03b3\n\u2032\nZ\ni\n)\u2009=\u20090 and \u03a6(\n\u03c9\nJ\n\u2212\n\u03b2\n\u2032\nX\ni\n\u2212\n\u03b3\n\u2032\nZ\ni\n)\u2009=\u20091.\nAs is well known, the estimates in\n\u03b2\nare not the impacts of road access variables on subjective well\u2010being because Equation\n2\nis nonlinear. Therefore, to quantify the impacts of road access on subjective well\u2010being,\n            the marginal effects need to be estimated and can be represented as:\n(3)\nBecause \u03a6(\n\u03c9\n0\n\u2212\n\u03b2\n\u2032\nX\ni\n\u2212\n\u03b3\n\u2032\nZ\ni\n)\u2009=\u20090 and \u03a6(\n\u03c9\nJ\n\u2212\n\u03b2\n\u2032\nX\ni\n\u2212\n\u03b3\n\u2032\nZ\ni\n)\u2009=\u20091, it is also straightforward to see that when\nj\n=\u20090 or J, \u03a6\u2032(\n\u03c9\nj\n)\u2009=\u20090.\nOur empirical strategy is undertaken in two steps. The first step is to estimate the\n            ordered probit (OPROBIT) equation (Equation\n2\n) using the maximum likelihood estimation. Apart from the OPROBIT estimates, we also\n            produce the standard OLS and ordered logit (OLOGIT) estimates. Although the OLS estimates\n            are, arguably, less satisfactory than the OPROBIT counterpart, at least from a theoretical\n            point of view, the additional OLS model yields a robustness check of our baseline\n            OPROBIT model. Another robustness check is to examine the OLOGIT estimates whereby\n            the logistic function enters Equation\n2\nin lieu of the cumulative normal distribution function under OPROBIT. Because the\n            numerical difference between the OLOGIT and OPROBIT results, as is well known, is\n            likely to be infinitesimal, our main findings are qualitatively unaffected by the\n            choice between OLOGIT and OPROBIT. To develop further analyses, we opt for the OPROBIT\n            estimates as our baseline results. Due to variation in the size of households in our\n            sample, the stochastic error term \u03b5\ni\ntends to be heteroskedastic, and the estimates can potentially be biased. To address\n            this issue, we employ heteroskedasticity\u2010robust estimators in all estimations. Having\n            obtained the parameter estimates in Equation\n2\n, we then undertake the second step by evaluating the marginal effects of road access\n            variables on subjective well\u2010being at the mean, based on Equation\n3\n.\nIV Data Sources and Measurement\nThe main dataset used in this paper is from the TSLS fielded by the National Statistics\n            Directorate (Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional de Estat\u00edstica) with support from the multi\u2010donor Planning\n            and Financial Management Capacity Building Program managed by the World Bank.\n8\nThe 2007 TSLS is the second national survey of living standards, following the first\n            survey in 2001.\n9\nThis survey is a multi\u2010purpose study of a nationally representative sample of households\n            in Timor\u2010Leste, containing 1800 observations. The 2007 TSLS kicked off in March 2006\n            and was designed to run over a full\u2010year period. Due to the outbreak of the conflict\n            in the country, the survey was suspended after 8\u2009weeks. It resumed in January 2007\n            and successfully concluded in January 2008.\nIn the 2007 TSLS, the most knowledgeable member of a household was asked to report\n            on six aspects of subjective wellbeing: (i) food consumption; (ii) housing situation;\n            (iii) clothing situation; (iv) healthcare situation; (v) income situation; and (vi)\n            child education. The questions asked were: \u2018Concerning your household's \u2026 over the\n            past 1\u2009month, which of the following is true?\u2019. Subjective well\u2010being was reported\n            in three levels: \u2018less than adequate\u2019, \u2018just adequate\u2019 and \u2018more than adequate\u2019.\nFigure\n4\nillustrates the distribution of samples across the three levels of subjective well\u2010being.\n            Most households tended to report either \u2018less than adequate\u2019 or \u2018just adequate\u2019 in\n            all subjective well\u2010being questions, ranging from 30 to 70 percent of sample households.\n            Interestingly, only approximately 10\u201320 households rated \u2018more than adequate\u2019 in each\n            category. As shown in Figure\n2\n, the distribution of subjective well\u2010being in Timor\u2010Leste is skewed to the left as\n            households are more likely to report either \u2018less than adequate\u2019 or \u2018just adequate\u2019\n            as opposed to \u2018more than adequate\u2019 in the various aspects of well\u2010being.\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nDistribution of subjective well\u2010being by category\nCaption\nDistribution of subjective well\u2010being by category\nTwo variables capture road infrastructure available to households and, thus, enter\n            the vector\nX\ni\nin Equations\n1\nand\n2\n.\n10\nThe first measures proximity, or the average walk time (in terms of minutes) to the\n            nearest roads, denoted by\nWTNR\ni\n. In principle, this variable of commuting time represents \u2018quantity\u2019 of road infrastructure\n            accessible to households in that more road access, presumably, implies shorter average\n            walk time to nearest roads. Besides quantity, we also attempt to account for the \u2018quality\u2019\n            of roads by including the second road infrastructure variable: a dummy of whether\n            or not roads are accessible during rainy season. Denoted by\nRROAD\ni\n, the dummy of road accessibility during the rainy season takes the value of unity\n            if households report that roads remain intact during the rainy season, and nil otherwise.\n            As discussed in Section II, greater access to roads is expected to entail improved\n            subjective well\u2010being. Therefore, the coefficient of the average walk time to the\n            nearest roads (\nWTNR\ni\n) is expected to be negative, whereas that of the dummy of road accessibility during\n            the rainy season (\nRROAD\ni\n) is expected to exhibit a positive sign.\nApart from the road access variables, we also control for various household consumption\n            expenditures measured in terms of dollar values per household member per month and\n            entering the specifications in logarithmic form.\n11\nBecause utility is derived from consumption, greater household consumption expenditures\n            are hypothesized to render higher levels of subjective well\u2010being. The first is the\n            rent expenditure (\nrent\ni\n). It should be highlighted that rent expenditure is applicable for all households,\n            regardless of whether paying rent or not. If the households dwell in rented residences,\nrent\ni\nis the actual rental expenditure incurred. If the households do not incur rental\n            expenditure because, for example, they own their own homes or reside with relatives,\nrent\ni\nis proxied by the amount of rental payments that the households would have incurred\n            if they needed to rent the dwelling.\nOther household spending also enters the specifications. Utility consumption expenditure\n            (\nutility\ni\n) includes fuel, electricity, telephone, water, and maintenance and repair expenses.\n            Food expenditure (\nfood\ni\n) pertains to various food\u2010related items, including cereals, meat, vegetables and\n            beverages. Non\u2010food expenditure (\nnfood\ni\n) accounts for items such as personal care products (e.g. soap, shampoo and toothpaste),\n            cosmetics, personal services (e.g. haircuts, shaving and manicures), entertainment\n            expenses and payments for various services.\nIn addition to household expenditure, we also control for other household\u2010specific\n            characteristics.\nWTAC\ni\nis the average walk time (in minutes) to community centers; namely, Aldeia. As in\n            Brereton\net al.\n(\n2008\n), proximity to facilities matters to well\u2010being. In the context of Timor\u2010Leste, households\n            located closer to Aldeia have better access to facilities such as education and healthcare,\n            and basic necessities like clean water and electricity, and, hence, tend to exhibit\n            a higher level of well\u2010being.\nHHSIZE\ni\nis the number of household members and captures household size. The relationship\n            between household size and subjective well\u2010being is relatively inconclusive as it\n            varies across countries and depends on cultural and institutional factors (Winkelmann,\n2005\n). In the context of Timor\u2010Leste, we are inclined to expect a positive relationship\n            due to a pivotal role of informal social safety nets within a family (World Bank,\n2013\n). The dummy of whether a household is poor (\nPOOR\ni\n) is a subjective measure of poverty as in Colasanto\net al.\n(\n1984\n). Specifically, two questions were asked: \u2018In your opinion, how much would your household\n            need each month so that you can think of yourself as \u2018not poor\u2019?\u2019 and \u2018What amount\n            of food and other goods did your household have in the last month?\u2019 If the answer\n            to the first question is larger than that to the second, a household is classified\n            as \u2018poor\u2019 (\nPOOR\ni\n=\u20091), and \u2018not poor\u2019 otherwise. All else equal, a poor household is expected to attain\n            a lower level of subjective well\u2010being than a non\u2010poor household.\nCHILD\ni\nis the dummy of whether a household has children. It takes the value of unity if\n            there is at least one child in a household and nil otherwise. Like the impacts of\n            household size, a relationship between a household having children and subjective\n            well\u2010being is less certain, as the existing evidence yields contrasting results across\n            countries (see e.g. Clark and Oswald,\n1994\n; Marks and Fleming,\n1999\n; Clark\net al.,\n2001\n; and Frijters\net al.,\n2002\n).\nLastly, we control for geographical locations of households as the area or location\n            where an individual lives can also affect the quality of life, as demonstrated by\n            Roback (\n1982\n); Blomquist\net al.\n(\n1988\n) and, more recently, Chay and Greenstone (\n2005\n). Intuitively, spatial factors tend to shape the availability of facilities, as well\n            as the quality of livelihood and environment, which, in turn, influence standards\n            of living and well\u2010being. In our empirical framework, there are four locations: Dili\n            (the capital city of Timor\u2010Leste), Bacau, other urban areas and rural areas.

Because our empirical setting builds upon the ordered response function and is,\n               hence, nonlinear, the parameter estimates can only indicate the directions of the\n               relationship between subjective well\u2010being and the control variables. To quantify\n               the extent to which access to road infrastructure influences subjective well\u2010being,\n               the marginal effects analysis is discussed in Subsection V.2.\nTables\n3-5\nshow parameter estimates of the subjective well\u2010being equation (Equation\n2\n) from the OLS, OLOGIT and OPROBIT models, respectively. The goodness of fit of all\n               model specifications is satisfactory as the F\u2010statistics in the case of OLS, and the\n               Wald \u03c7\n2\n\u2010statistics in the case of OLOGIT and OPROBIT models are all statistically significant\n               at the 1 percent level. The R\n2\nand pseudo R\n2\n\u2010values turn out to be rather low, between 0.1 and 0.2, but within the usual range\n               for cross\u2010section datasets. In the tables, each column represents the estimates of\n               each aspect of subjective well\u2010being, including food, housing, clothing, healthcare,\n               income and child education.\nTable 3.\nOLS estimations of the subjective well\u2010being equations\nDependent variable: Levels of subjective well\u2010being\nVariable\nFood\nHousing\nClothing\nHealthcare\nIncome\nChild education\nWTNR\ni\n\u2013.0001(.0007)\n.0015\n*\n(.0008)\n\u2013.0001(.0006)\n.0013\n*\n(.0007)\n\u2013.0007(.0005)\n.0001(.0008)\nRROAD\ni\n.2294\n***\n(.0375)\n.1817\n***\n(.0422)\n.1310\n***\n(.0377)\n.2860\n***\n(.0438)\n.1180\n***\n(.0318)\n.1579\n***\n(.0432)\nln(\nrent\ni\n)\n.0243\n*\n(.0126)\n.0616\n***\n(.0126)\n.0419\n***\n(.0127)\n.0028(.0129)\n.0194(.0124)\n.0126(.0141)\nln(\nutility\ni\n)\n.0750\n***\n(.0154)\n.0571\n***\n(.0155)\n.0570\n***\n(.0153)\n.1017\n***\n(.0160)\n.0605\n***\n(.0148)\n.0585\n***\n(.0168)\nln(\nfood\ni\n)\n.0465\n***\n(.0126)\n.0002(.0135)\n.0357\n***\n(.0126)\n\u2013.0009(.0140)\n.0520\n***\n(.0121)\n.0506\n***\n(.0152)\nln(\nnfood\ni\n)\n.0665\n***\n(.0110)\n.0216\n*\n(.0113)\n.0597\n***\n(.0109)\n\u2013.0132(.0121)\n.0482\n***\n(.0107)\n.0256\n**\n(.0121)\nWTAC\ni\n\u2013.0001(.0004)\n\u2013.0017\n***\n(.0004)\n\u2013.0004(.0003)\n\u2013.0001(.0005)\n\u2013.0001(.0003)\n\u2013.0013\n***\n(.0004)\nHHSIZE\ni\n.0213\n***\n(.0067)\n.0175\n***\n(.0060)\n.0190\n***\n(.0065)\n.0190\n***\n(.0061)\n.0212\n***\n(.0061)\n.0319\n***\n(.0067)\nPOOR\ni\n\u2013.1072\n***\n(.0342)\n\u2013.1585\n***\n(.0354)\n\u2013.1177\n***\n(.0316)\n\u2013.1376\n***\n(.0376)\n\u2013.0449(.0323)\n\u2013.1163\n***\n(.0405)\nCHILD\ni\n.0471(.0508)\n.0894\n*\n(.0522)\n.1353\n***\n(.0443)\n.0323(.0569)\n.0460(.0551)\n\u2014\u2010\nDili\n\u2013.0272(.0687)\n\u2013.1026(.0710)\n\u2013.0267(.0703)\n\u2013.0407(.0783)\n\u2013.1415\n**\n(.0633)\n.0271(.0793)\nBaucau\n.0817(.0498)\n.1472\n***\n(.0473)\n.1280\n***\n(.0485)\n.1102\n**\n(.0485)\n.0701(.0483)\n.0645(.0535)\nOther urban areas\n.0655(.0453)\n.0776\n*\n(.0458)\n.1092\n**\n(.0438)\n.0706(.0487)\n.0358(.0412)\n.1095\n**\n(.0531)\nConstant\n\u2013.1801(.1917)\n.0505(.1958)\n\u2013.1757(.1898)\n.3679\n*\n(.2014)\n\u2013.0501(.1864)\n.2530(.2040)\nNumber of observations\n1073\n1073\n1073\n1073\n1073\n977\nF\u2010statistics\n29.99\n***\n34.17\n***\n28.71\n***\n19.78\n***\n13.65\n***\n17.11\n**\nR\n2\n.2105\n.2156\n.2151\n.1534\n.1521\n.1350\n***\n,\n**\nand\n*\nrepresent statistical significance at the 1, 5 and 10% level, respectively.

Even though modest sensitivity appears in the OLS estimates, the OLOGIT\n               and OPROBIT estimations, as expected, yield qualitatively identical results.\n26\nAs mentioned earlier in Section III, because OLS estimation fails to account for\n               the ordered response nature of the empirical framework, the discussions and analyses\n               in this section will focus on the OLOGIT and OPROBIT estimates. The main findings\n               can be summarized as follows.\nFirst and foremost, increasing the number of roads does not necessarily result in\n               improved subjective well\u2010being. Shorter distances to main roads appear to reduce subjective\n               well\u2010being in a couple of dimensions as\nWTNR\ni\nestimates turn out to be positive and statistically significant at 5 and 10 percent\n               for housing and healthcare satisfaction, respectively. The detrimental effects of\n               proximity to main roads on housing and health well\u2010being may be explained by the fact\n               that competition for prime housing locations, rental costs, traffic and congestion,\n               and pollution problems all increase in the vicinity of a main road. These results\n               are rather consistent with those if Brereton\net al.\n(\n2008\n), who employs GIS and finds that proximity to major roads diminishes subjective well\u2010being.\nMore importantly, what really matters to the subjective well\u2010being of Timorese is\n               road accessibility during the rainy season. As shown in Tables\n4\nand\n5\n, the coefficients of the dummy of road accessibility during the rainy season (\nRROAD\ni\n) are consistently positive and statistically significant at the 1\u2010percent level across\n               all estimations and all aspects of subjective well\u2010being. This implies that all other\n               things held constant, households who are able to access roads even during the rainy\n               season attain higher levels of subjective well\u2010being than those reporting otherwise.\n               As explained in Section II, in the context of a post\u2010conflict, newly emerging country\n               like Timor\u2010Leste, road access is the bloodline of economic activity. Access to roads\n               means access not only to transportation and various facilities, but also to opportunities,\n               including jobs, healthcare and education, that ultimately lead to improved standards\n               of living. If the objective is to enhance people's welfare and standard of living,\n               road infrastructure development should not just entail building more roads. Rather,\n               our findings suggest that it is necessary to improve the quality of roads such that\n               they remain intact at all times, thereby ensuring constant and uninterrupted accessibility.\nHousehold consumption expenditures are generally positively correlated with subjective\n               well\u2010being and, thus, are of the expected sign. This is consistent with our hypothesis\n               because households\u2019 utility, theoretically speaking, is a function of goods and services\n               consumed. Rents appear to boost all aspects of satisfaction except healthcare.\n27\nUtility consumption is a significant determinant of every well\u2010being aspect. Although\n               food consumption raises well\u2010being in terms of food, clothing, income and child education,\n               it is insignificant for housing and healthcare satisfaction. Likewise, consumption\n               of non\u2010food items matters to all well\u2010being aspects, again, except healthcare.\nAlthough the parameter estimates of walk time to the community centers (\nWTNR\ni\n) are generally negative and of the expected sign, they are statistically significant\n               only for subjective well\u2010being in terms of housing and child education. That said,\n               the shorter walking distance to the community centers implies higher satisfaction\n               with regard to housing and child education. The positive effects of shorter distance\n               to the community centers on subjective satisfaction of housing and child education\n               are intuitively understandable because better\u2010quality houses and schools tend to be\n               more concentrated around Aldeia.\nHouseholds with a larger number of members tend to achieve higher subjective well\u2010being\n               in all aspects. As presented in Tables\n4, 5\n, the coefficients of household size (\nHHSIZE\ni\n) are positive and statistically significant at 1 percent for all aspects of subjective\n               satisfaction in each estimated model. Although international evidence on the relationship\n               between household size and subjective well\u2010being is mixed and less clear\u2010cut, in the\n               context of Timor\u2010Leste, where formal social security is virtually absent, our evidence\n               underlines the pivotal role of informal social safety nets within a family. In Timor\u2010Leste,\n               families are large, with strong connections to extended family members; this enables\n               family members to support each other financially and socially in the face of economic\n               shocks (World Bank,\n2013\n).\nSubjective well\u2010being among poor households, as expected, appears to be inferior to\n               that of non\u2010poor households in that the coefficients of the poor dummy (\nPOOR\ni\n) are consistently negative and statistically significant at 1 percent. Interestingly,\n               the only exception is subjective well\u2010being of income in which the coefficient, albeit\n               negative, is statistically insignificant. This suggests that income satisfaction among\n               poor households is not statistically lower than that among non\u2010poor families. An explanation\n               perhaps rests with the role of informal and subsistence employment, which accounts\n               for approximately 70 percent of total employment in Timor\u2010Leste (ADB (Asian Development\n               Bank),\n2014\n). Even if a household has no employment income, its family members can resort to\n               subsistence activities, especially in agriculture, for livelihood.\nLastly, the coefficients of location dummies provide insight into the geographical\n               distribution of subjective well\u2010being. In comparison with rural households, households\n               in Dili report lower subjective well\u2010being. This is particularly the case for income\u2010related\n               satisfaction, as households in Dili tend to report that their income is less than\n               adequate compared to those in rural areas. The higher cost of living in the capital\n               city, relative to rural areas, is likely the primary cause of the perceived inadequacy\n               of incomes in Dili. While households in Dili can generally earn higher incomes, the\n               higher cost of living tends to result in little, if any, surplus income or savings.\n               Households in Baucau, Timor\u2010Leste's second largest city, appear to be more satisfied\n               than their rural counterparts in terms of housing, clothing and healthcare. Likewise,\n               households in other urban areas are better\u2010off in terms of housing, clothing and child\n               education, relative to those in rural areas.\n28\nV.2 Marginal effects of road access\nWhat are the impacts of road access on subjective well\u2010being? Although we have provided\n               a broad picture of the interplay between road access and subjective well\u2010being, the\n               derived coefficients in Subsection V.1 by themselves do not suffice in capturing the\n               extent to which road access influences each dimension of subjective well\u2010being due\n               to the nonlinear nature of our empirical framework. To answer this question, this\n               section examines the marginal effects of the road access variables and, thus, aims\n               to quantify and compare their impacts on subjective well\u2010being.\nFigures\n5\n,\n6\npresent the marginal effects of the three road access variables on subjective well\u2010being.\n               The marginal effects are measured as in Equation\n3\n, using the parameter estimates presented in Subsection V.1 evaluated at mean values.\n               The conventional interpretation of the height of each bar is the change in probability\n               that a household reports each level of subjective well\u2010being, with respect to a one\u2010unit\n               increase in the road access variable. For instance, in Figure\n5\n, the height of each bar should be interpreted as \u2018If walk time to main roads increases\n               by 1\u2009min, the probability that a household will report \u2026 will increase (decrease)\n               by \u2026\u2019. For presentation simplicity, the solid bars capture statistical significance\n               at least at the 10\u2010percent level, while the non\u2010solid bars imply statistical insignificance.\nFigure 5\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nThe marginal effects of walk time to nearest roads\nCaption\nThe marginal effects of walk time to nearest roads\nFigure 6\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nThe marginal effects of road accessibility during rainy season.\nCaption\nThe marginal effects of road accessibility during rainy season.\nVicinity to main roads undermines subjective well\u2010being. As demonstrated in Figure\n5\n, households adjacent to main roads appear to be worse off in terms of housing and\n               healthcare satisfaction. The marginal effects analyses indicate that an increase in\n               walk time to the nearest main roads by 1\u2009min will lower the probability of reporting\n               \u2018less than adequate\u2019 housing and healthcare by 0.17 and 0.12 percent, respectively;\n               boost the probability of reporting \u2018just adequate\u2019 by 0.16 percent for housing and\n               0.11 percent for healthcare; and also increase the probability of reporting \u2018more\n               than adequate\u2019 by 0.01 percent for both housing and healthcare. This implies that\n               in the context of Timor\u2010Leste, more roads may not necessarily translate into better\n               subjective well\u2010being.\nQuality of roads is of utmost importance to the welfare of Timorese. The marginal\n               effects of road accessibility during the rainy season in Figure\n6\nindicate that households reporting that roads are accessible during the rainy season\n               have lower tendency (by 13\u201325 percent) to report \u2018less than adequate\u2019 for all aspects\n               of subjective well\u2010being. Moreover, households with consistent all\u2010weather access\n               to roads are more likely to report \u2018just adequate\u2019 (by 13\u201324 percent) and \u2018more than\n               adequate\u2019 (by 0.3\u20133.0 percent) across all aspects of subjective well\u2010being.\nIn summary, the empirical exercise in this section highlights that in Timor\u2010Leste,\n               building more roads is not necessarily welfare enhancing. Rather, the estimates suggest\n               that Timorese households need better quality roads: roads that are climate\u2010proof and\n               accessible all year round regardless of weather conditions.\nV.3 Robustness check\nOur empirical findings presented thus far build upon the 2007 TSLS: the latest household\n               survey available at the time of writing. The cross\u2010sectional nature of our dataset\n               means that the findings only describe statistical relationships at a single point\n               in time. Given this limitation, the question of whether our empirical results still\n               hold in other time periods remains. One possible avenue for investigating this question\n               is to replicate our empirical strategies using the country's first living standard\n               survey; namely, the 2001 Timor\u2010Leste Living Standards Measurement Survey (TLSMS).\nAlthough one way to incorporate the first wave information is to pool the 2001 and\n               2007 TSLS datasets and implement panel estimations, non\u2010matching household identification\n               numbers do not allow us to link the sample households in the two datasets. In addition,\n               even if the two datasets can be pooled, they contain information for only two points\n               in time. Unless there are significant differences in the findings of the two datasets,\n               the pooled sample results are unlikely to deviate from our main findings.\nWe implement exactly the same data construction and empirical strategies using the\n               2001 TLSMS and find qualitatively unchanged results. To save space, in this section\n               we recapitulate the sensitivity and robustness of our results based on the 2001 TLSMS,\n               instead of repeating figures and tables similar to those in Subsections V.1 and V.2.\n               For interested readers, the detailed estimates are available upon request.\nProximity to main roads has no significant impact on subjective well\u2010being in all\n               aspects in the 2001 TLSMS and, therefore, differs from the 2007 TSLS results in which\n               walk time to main roads turned out to be unfavorable to satisfaction in terms of housing\n               and healthcare.\nMore importantly, our main result that quality of roads matters to subjective well\u2010being\n               is remarkably robust in the 2001 TLSMS dataset. The marginal effects of road accessibility\n               during the rainy season are positive and statistically significant in all aspects\n               of subjective well\u2010being. In particular, the estimates reveal that in comparison with\n               those without all\u2010weather access to roads, households with road accessibility even\n               during the rainy season, on average, have lower probability of reporting \u2018less than\n               adequate\u2019 (by 13.0\u201323.0 percent) and higher tendency of reporting \u2018just adequate\u2019\n               and \u2018more than adequate\u2019 (by 11.0\u201321.0 percent and 0.2\u20132.0 percent, respectively)\n               across every measured aspect of subjective well\u2010being.\nVI Conclusion\nFor a post\u2010conflict, newly emerging country like Timor\u2010Leste, roads are the bloodline\n            of virtually all economic activities and serve as a catalyst of sustainable growth\n            and inclusive development. Therefore, the questions of whether, and how, road access\n            affects people's well\u2010being and welfare are critical. The answers to these questions\n            can shed light on appropriate policy interventions that can help raise the standard\n            of living in Timor\u2010Leste.\nThis paper employs the standard models for ordered responses to empirically investigate\n            the impacts of road access on various aspects of subjective well\u2010being, including\n            adequacy of food, housing, clothing, healthcare, income and child education. The unique\n            feature of our empirical exercise is the notion that road access involves not only\n            physical proximity offered by road infrastructure, but also quality of roads; that\n            is, whether roads are still accessible during the rainy season. The estimates reveal\n            satisfactorily robust evidence that proximity to main roads may not necessarily improve\n            household well\u2010being. Rather, what matters to Timorese standards of living is road\n            quality: the extent to which roads are all\u2010weather accessible.\nIf the government has limited financial resources to prioritize either building more\n            roads or maintaining existing roads, the empirical results suggest the latter because\n            increasing quality of roads is more welfare\u2010enhancing than building new roads. Our\n            econometrics framework predicts that maintaining accessibility of roads even during\n            the rainy season essentially reduces the probability of households reporting \u2018less\n            than adequate\u2019 across all aspects of subjective well\u2010being by 13\u201325 percent, and raises\n            the tendency of reporting \u2018just adequate\u2019 and \u2018more than adequate\u2019 by 13\u201324 percent\n            and 0.3\u20133.0 percent, respectively. In Timor\u2010Leste, intense rainfall and geographical\n            instability often cause either partial or full blockage of roads. A shutdown of roads\n            means a shutdown of access to food supplies, job opportunities, schooling, health\n            services and other necessities for isolated areas. The issue of improving road quality\n            in Timor\u2010Leste is not new as it has already been central to public policy debates\n            among the government, development partners and the international community. However,\n            the present paper, to our knowledge, is the first to quantify the effects of ensuring\n            road accessibility during the rainy season and to highlight that road rehabilitation\n            offers an effective channel for enhancing people's well\u2010being in Timor\u2010Leste.\nLike all other studies on subjective well\u2010being, the present paper is not without\n            limitations. For instance, some control variables such as household expenditures are\n            not likely to be exogenous. As is well known, the expenditure endogeneity tends to\n            underestimate the impacts on subjective well\u2010being, necessitating the use of instrumental\n            variables. In addition, there may be omitted variable biases. Because the survey was\n            disrupted and delayed by political conflict, the estimates are subject to seasonal\n            biases. For example, households surveyed during the rainy season are more prone to\n            report no access to roads during the rainy season. Likewise, household proximity to\n            facilities can also be influenced by many unobservable socioeconomic factors such\n            as proximity to relatives, location preferences, culture and housing affordability.\n            Although these issues are by all means crucial to our analysis, limited data availability\n            does not allow us to fully address these concerns at the time of writing this paper.\n            Future research is necessary to address these issues more critically.\nNotes :\n2\nAs discussed later in this paper, the 2007 TSLS is the second wave and the latest\n            available information at the time of writing. Although the reported household identification\n            numbers do not allow us to pool the 2007 TSLS with its preceding survey, the 2001\n            TSLS, we employ the 2001 TSLS to replicate our empirical strategies for a robustness\n            check. The results are discussed in Subsection V.3.\n7\nAs detailed later in this paper, the household samples were asked to report their\n            concerns over various aspects of living standards in three levels: less than adequate,\n            just adequate and more than adequate. Less than adequate indicates the lowest level\n            of satisfaction, while more than adequate implies the highest level of satisfaction.\n8\nBasic information of the TSLS is available at:\nhttp://dne.mof.gov.tl/TLSLS/AboutTLSLS/\n.\n9\nDue to differences in the overall survey design and coding inconsistencies, we decided\n            not to pool the 2007 TSLS and 2001 TSLS. Rather, we separately replicate the same\n            empirical methodology discussed in Subsection III.1 in the 2001 TSLS dataset to perform\n            a robustness check. More detailed discussions are relegated to Subsection V.3.\n10\nAn implicit, rather strong assumption is that road access is exogenous. Admittedly,\n            this is not likely to be the case in reality as road infrastructure is not random\n            and is underpinned by local needs, government policies and strategies, and many other\n            unobservable socioeconomic factors. Endogeneity of road access variables, as is well\n            known, may cause estimation biases. The standard way to address this selection bias\n            issue is to resort to instrumental variable (IV) regression. However, the limited\n            scope of the survey does not allow for valid IV.\n11\nThe use of consumption variables as control variables may lead to estimation biases\n            of the road access impacts on well\u2010being. The reason is that the road access in principle\n            ushers in economic opportunities through improved mobility of goods, services and\n            people, which ultimately influence household consumption. However, as shown in Table\n2\n, the correlation between road access and consumption expenditure is satisfactorily\n            low in the range of \u22120.12 and 0.04 for\nWTNR\ni\n, and in the rage of \u22120.03 and 0.23 for\nRROAD\ni\n. The estimation biases arising from consumption effects are likely to be limited.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

Aims: To (1) describe illness beliefs in patients with\n            recurrent symptomatic AF and (2) describe relationships among illness beliefs having\n            implications for self\u2010management.\nMethods:\nSubjects (n = 207), 56% male, 64.2 \u00b1 12.3 years, from an arrhythmia clinic completed\n            the Illness Perception Questionnaire\u2010Revised.

Subjects\n            believed psychological factors, age, and heredity caused AF and reported that AF induced\n            worry, anxiety, and depression. Stronger beliefs about AF as cyclic, unpredictable\n            (r = 0.30), having psychological causes, (r = .36), and greater consequences (r =\n            .58) were associated with more negative emotion.

The diagnosis of OA is usually based on clinical history and signs and symptoms, with the support of\n            in vivo and in vitro tests when identification of the specific allergen is required.\n            To date, no specific test is available for the diagnosis of the whole spectrum of\n            the different forms of OA. The lack of recommendations on diagnosis of OA is considered a medical need not only for allergists but also for ophthalmologists.\n            This position paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the currently available\n            tools for diagnosing OA to promote a common nomenclature and procedures to be used by different specialists.\n            Questionnaires, sign and symptom grading scales, tests, and potential biomarkers for\n            OA are reviewed. We also identified several unmet needs in the diagnostic tools to generate\n            interest, increase understanding, and inspire further investigations. Tools, recommendations,\n            and algorithms for the diagnosis of OA are proposed for use by both allergists and ophthalmologists. Several unmet needs\n            in the diagnostic tools should be further improved by specific clinical research in\n            OA.\n1 Introduction and Current Classification of Ocular Allergy\nThe term allergic conjunctivitis (AC) or ocular allergy (OA) refers to a collection\n            of ocular surface disorders that affect the eyelid and conjunctiva. IgE\u2010 and non\u2010IgE\u2010mediated\n            hypersensitivity disorders include intermittent/seasonal and persistent/perennial\n            allergic conjunctivitis (SAC and PAC according to the historical nomenclature and\n            classification), the diseases vernal and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (VKC and AKC),\n            and contact blepharoconjunctivitis (CBC)\n1\n(Table\n1\n). These clinical subtypes are diagnosed and managed by ophthalmologists, allergists,\n            pediatricians, and rhinologists usually considering clinical history and signs and\n            symptoms, aided by in vivo and in vitro tests when identification of the specific\n            allergic sensitization is required.\n1\nWhile clinical characteristics can provide a relatively convincing diagnosis, in\n            their initial or chronic stages there can be some confusion as to which form of allergy\n            is present. At times, pseudo\u2010allergic forms, with clinical manifestations similar\n            to allergy but with a nonallergic equivocal pathogenesis, are difficult to distinguish\n            from OA forms. In fact, several ocular surface diseases, including tear film dysfunction,\n            blepharitis, infections, and toxic and mechanical conjunctivitis, may mimic the clinical\n            pictures of OA.\n1\nTo date, there is no specific clinical and laboratory evaluation suitable for the\n            diagnosis and monitoring of OA. Ancillary tests, such as skin prick test and the identification\n            of serum\u2010specific IgE, can be useful for diagnosis and management; however, it is\n            well known that the results may not correlate with the ocular disease triggers.As\n            in many other diseases, accurate, rapid diagnosis and, in particular, the paucity\n            of guidelines on OA diagnosis represent major unmet needs.\n2\nThis EAACI Task Force aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the currently available\n            tools to make recommendations concerning the diagnosis of OA in daily clinical practice.\nTable 1.\nClinical features of major ocular allergy syndromes, including the underlying hypersensitivity\n               mechanism and ophthalmological presentation (adapted from Leonardi et al., Allergy\n               2012)\nSAC\nPAC\nVKC\nAKC\nGPC\nCBC\nPresentation\nIntermittent\nPersistent\nPersistent\u00b1intermittent exacerbations\nChronic\nPersistent\nChronic\u00b1intermittent exacerbations\nAllergic Mechanism\nIgE\u2010mediated\nIgE\u2010mediated\nIgE\u2010 and non\u2010IgE\u2010mediated\nIgE\u2010 and non\u2010IgE\u2010mediated\nNonallergic\nNon\u2010IgE\u2010mediated\nBackground\nAtopic\nAtopic\nChildhood\u00b1atopic\nAdult atopic\nAtopic or nonatopic\nNonatopic\nEyelids\nNA\n\u00b1Palpebral edema\nEyelid edema\nEczema+meibomitis blepharitis\nNA\nErythema, eczema\nConjunctiva\nFollicles &/or papillae\nFollicles &/or papillae\nGiant papillae\nPapillae\u00b1fibrosis\nGiant papillae\n\u00b1Hyperemia Follicles\nLimbus\nNA\nNA\n\u00b1Thickened+Trantas dots\n\u00b1Thickened\u00b1Trantas dots\nHyperemia\nNA\nCornea\nNA\nNA\nSPK\u00b1ulcer\u00b1vernal plaque\nSPK, ulcer, plaque, opacities, neovascularization\nRare\nNA\nSAC, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis; PAC, perennial allergic conjunctivitis; VKC,\n                     vernal keratoconjunctivitis; AKC, atopic keratoconjunctivitis; GPC, giant papillary\n                     conjunctivitis; CBC, contact blepharoconjunctivitis; SPK, superficial punctate keratitis;\n                     NA, not affected.\n2 Methods\nA systematic review of the literature was performed in PubMed and ScienceDirect databases,\n            using the following key words: Allergic Conjunctivitis or Ocular Allergy [AND] Diagnosis\n            workup, Investigations, Imaging, Questionnaire/QoL, Scoring/Grading, Instruments/Specific\n            tools, Clinical, Visual function/acuity, Ocular sampling/Tears, Tear Function, Biomarkers,\n            and Psychological impact.

Experts were contacted to suggest other studies not previously\n            revealed from the database search. Studies were considered if they included human\n            subjects, irrespective of age and race, and addressed diagnostic procedures and diagnostic\n            utilities, regardless of the type of OA. No time or language limitations were established.\n            Papers were selected according to the information provided on the title and abstract.\n            Each topic was reviewed by two independent experts and finally included and analyzed\n            by the whole panel. Evidence to support each point was reviewed, and a consensus decision\n            was made for each chapter. As evidence regarding a diagnostic procedure was limited,\n            some of the recommendations were based on consensus\u2010driven proposals by the task force\n            working group.\n3 Patient's Clinical History\n3.1 Rationale\nThe patient's medical history is the first crucial step in the diagnosis of OA, especially\n               in the differential diagnosis of \u201cred eye,\u201d one of the most common ophthalmic conditions.\n3\nA well\u2010performed medical history may help to understand the etiology of the conjunctivitis.\nThe medical history should cover types of symptoms (itching, burning, photophobia,\n               discharge, visual changes, pain), whether there is unilateral or bilateral eye involvement,\n               duration of symptoms, presence of allergies or systemic diseases, previous treatments,\n               family history, environmental and occupational exposures, use of contact lenses, and\n               any type of ocular medication and surgery.\n1\n3.2 Signs and symptoms\nOcular\nitching\nis the hallmark subjective symptom of OA. It indicates the release of histamine from\n               conjunctival mast cells and the activation of H1 receptors on nerve endings.\n1\nEyelid itching frequently occurs in blepharitis patients especially if related to\n               eyelash infestation.\nOcular\nredness\n(\nhyperemia\n) is the primary sign of OA due to conjunctival vasodilatation, which is often diffuse.\n               Localized hyperemia is suggestive of subconjunctival hemorrhage or episcleritis. Photographic\n               scales can be helpful in minimizing subjective observer variability.\nTearing\nor \u201cwatery eyes\u201d is a nonspecific consequence of the lacrimal gland response reflex\n               to several stimuli involving conjunctival and nasal sensory nerve endings. Tearing\n               is associated with OA but also other forms of ocular surface diseases such as infectious\n               and mechanical conjunctivitis, and with evaporative dry eye.\nEdema is easy to observe when limited to eyelid swelling but can also involve the\n               conjunctiva, resulting in\nchemosis\n. This symptom is easy to observe if intense. When mild or moderate, slit lamp examination\n               is required.\nPain\nis not a typical symptom of OA, but indicates a corneal involvement in VKC and AKC.\nAllergic patients may report mild\nvisual disturbances,\nblurring or normal vision. Visual impairment is a sign of corneal involvement in\n               VKC and AKC.\nDischarge\nis usually watery or serous; mucopurulent or purulent discharge suggests infectious\n               conjunctivitis; bilateral discharge upon wakening is a sign of blepharitis; sticky\n               mucous discharge and tearing, especially if associated with severe photophobia, are\n               significant indicators of VKC and AKC.\nBilateral involvement\nis typical for OA. Asymmetrical forms are possible. In viral conjunctivitis, the\n               symptoms are often unilateral at onset and become bilateral after 1 or 2 days.\nTime of onset\nof the first symptoms of SAC and PAC is during adolescence and young adulthood (80%\n               of patients are younger than 30 years old) and infrequently in older patients.\n4\nIn boys, VKC begins rarely before the age of 3 or after puberty and usually subsides\n               after puberty.\n5\nIt is observed more commonly in warm climates.\n6\nIn AKC, symptoms may appear at 30\u201050 years of age, sometimes years after being diagnosed\n               with atopic dermatitis or asthma.\n7\nOverlaps or evolutions from VKC to AKC may occur.\nIn intermittent OA/SAC, the onset and\nduration of symptoms\nare limited to the pollen season or to the local seasonal variability of specific\n               allergens including mites. Symptoms recur every season but are self\u2010limiting.\n8\nIn persistent OA/PAC, symptoms are usually mild but persistent, exacerbating after\n               increased or chronic exposure to allergens such as house dust mites, animal dander,\n               occupational allergens,\n9\n,\n10\nor to nonspecific irritating factors. PAC and AKC may also present with seasonal\n               exacerbations. VKC worsens in the spring and summer. If severe, symptoms can be observed\n               all year round. In CBC, attention should be made to substances applied into or around\n               the eye (medications, cosmetics, etc.).\n9\nIf suspected, a work\u2010related allergy has to be confirmed by worsening of symptoms\n               in the workplace.\n1\n,\n10\nIn CBC, the delay between the exposure to the allergen and the occurrence of symptoms\n               is usually longer. Some nonspecific factors such as smoke, pollution, or wind can\n               increase symptoms of OA.\n11\nIn addition, food or food additives may influence OA.\nMany patients have a history of\ncomorbidity\nwith other allergic diseases. Conjunctival symptoms are present in 30%\u201071% of patients\n               with allergic rhinitis (AR).\n11\nAC alone has been estimated in 6%\u201030% of the general population and in up to 30%\n               of children, alone or in association with AR.\n12\nUp to 40%\u201075% of VKC patients suffer from other allergic diseases.\n12\nAKC is present in up to 40% of atopic dermatitis patients, and the comorbidity with\n               atopic dermatitis and asthma is around 90%.\n13\nIt is always necessary to consider patients\u2019 activity limitations, sleep problems,\n               coexisting nose, and respiratory and cutaneous problems but also practical and emotional\n               aspects.\n3.3 Recommendations\nAccurate medical and personal history is fundamental for diagnosis.\nConsider different causes of red eye.\nAlways ask for ocular signs and symptoms in other allergic comorbidities.\nInvestigate triggers for signs and symptoms.\nRefer to an ophthalmologist especially in cases of severe symptoms, unilateral redness,\n                     ocular pain, visual disturbance, or long\u2010term use of topical drugs\n.\n3.4 Unmet needs\nPrimary care awareness in OA.\nStandardized questionnaire to be used by both ophthalmologists and allergists.\n4 Clinical Ocular Examination\n4.1 Rationale\nDiagnosis of OA relies on the combination of a suggestive medical history and conjunctivitis\n               signs (Figure\n1\nand Table\n1\n). Some relevant clinical signs can be assessed by nonophthalmologists (Table\n2\n) although most of them are not specific for allergy and may be present in any type\n               of conjunctivitis. Some specific signs of VKC/AKC may be visualized by macroscopic\n               examination: superior tarsal conjunctival giant papillae (visible after lid eversion)\n               and Trantas dots (white/gray inflammatory infiltrates at the limbus) (Figure\n2\n). Lid eczema is a specific marker for AKC. Ophthalmological examination reveals conjunctival\n               papillary hypertrophy, follicles, scarring, blepharitis (lid margin inflammation),\n               meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) (Figure\n3\n), and tear instability, an important sign of dry eye. Corneal involvement, found\n               only in VKC and AKC, is a marker of severity. Superficial corneal epitheliopathy,\n               neovascularization, and scars are nonspecific, whereas shield ulcers and plaques are\n               much more suggestive of severe VKC and AKC (Figure\n4\n).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nAlgorithm for the diagnosis of ocular allergy. The presence of signs and symptoms\n                        suggesting ocular allergy (OA) or the presence of signs and symptoms usually not associated with OA together with an accurate medical history is the first step in the diagnostic algorithm.\n                        In case of unusual signs and symptoms, the differential diagnosis can be made considering\n                        the wide spectrum of disorders affecting the ocular surface after consulting an ophthalmologist.\n                        When signs and symptoms suggest OA, primary skin or\nin vitro\ntesting in addition to the clinical characteristic of each ocular disease (Tables\n1\nand\n2\n) will consent to define a specific ocular allergic disorder. If primary diagnostic\n                        tools are uncertain or negative, secondary, more specific, local diagnostic test may\n                        help to either define a specific ocular hypersensitivity disease or suggest a proper\n                        differential diagnosis\nCaption\nAlgorithm for the diagnosis of ocular allergy.

To evaluate the superior palpebral conjunctiva,\n               use lid eversion. More accurate ocular examination requires the use of a slit lamp.\n               Corneal and conjunctival epitheliopathy are assessed by fluorescein staining usually\n               under slit lamp evaluation (Figure\n4\n).\n4.3 Recommendations\nAlways look at the eyelid skin and the lid margin.\nWhen slit lamp is not available, look at the eye using natural light.\nExamination by an ophthalmologist is required in atypical or severe cases.\n5 Scoring OA and Quality of Life\n5.1 Rationale and definitions\nDifferent scales and criteria have been used, highlighting the difficulties encountered\n               in grading acute and chronic manifestations. Main indications for scoring signs and\n               symptoms include evaluating the disease severity, assessing the response to conjunctival\n               and nasal provocation tests (CPT and NPT), and the efficacy of therapeutic agents.\nHealth\u2010related quality of life (QoL) has been defined as \u201cthe functional effects of\n               an illness and its resulting therapy upon a patient, as perceived by the patient.\u201d\n               OA may significantly impact activities such as reading, computer or tablet use, recreation,\n               games, sports, television, movies, and electronics. These disturbances generate worries,\n               anxiety, and some psychological discomfort for the patient and family and impact on\n               daily tasks, work, leisure, sleep, and mood. To date, no specific QoL questionnaire\n               has been validated for OA, except for VKC. In terms of important patient\u2010reported\n               outcomes, the ocular component of AR impacts patient QoL in meaningful ways.\n14\n5.2 Instruments\n5.2.1 Grading signs and symptoms\nThe visual analog scale (VAS), mainly used in clinical trials,\n15\nis a useful semiquantitative method to express the intensity of symptoms by the patients.\n                  The self\u2010recording is performed on a 100\u2010mm scale without marked intervals by indicating\n                  the most severe symptoms on the far right and the absence of symptoms on the far left.\n                  The severity of subjective symptoms may also range from 0 to 10.\n5.2.2 Grading questionnaires\nThe score may be based on the duration of symptoms: 0=no symptom; 1=\u201csome of the time\u201d;\n                  2=\u201chalf of the time\u201d; 3=\u201cmost of the time\u201d; 4=\u201call the time.\u201d The QoL in VKC children\n                  (QUICK) questionnaire\n16\nuses a 3\u2010point scale: 1=never; 2=sometimes; 3=always. The total sum score obtained\n                  determines the status of the disease.\n5.2.3 Ocular severity scores\nThe \u201cseverity index\u201d (SI) system is based on the patient's subjective assessment of\n                  the severity of each particular symptom and the grade of severity of objective findings:\n                  0=no signs or symptoms; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe. The SI is calculated as the\n                  total score of individual signs and symptoms (Appendix\nS1\n). In 2012,\n1\n,\n17\nwe proposed a severity classification of OA based on ARIA criteria\n17\n(Table\n3\n). For severe and chronic forms (VKC, AKC), a 3\u2010grade score for corneal ulcer assessment\n                  has been used: grade 1: ulcers that extend the beyond the epithelial basal membrane\n                  and yet have a transparent base; grade 2: ulcers with opaque base and partially filled\n                  with inflammatory debris; and grade 3: ulcers filled with debris (plaque) remaining\n                  above the surrounding epithelium.\nTable 3.\nGrading of symptoms and severity of hypersensitivity disorders at the ocular surface\n                     based on ARIA criteria\nA. Persistence of symptoms\n\u201cIntermittent\u201d means that the symptoms (\nitching and redness\n) are present:\n\u25cb\nLess than 4 d a wk\n\u25cb\nOr for less than 4 wks\n\u201cPersistent\u201d means that the symptoms (\nitching and redness\n) are present:\n\u25cb\nMore than 4 d a wk\n\u25cb\nAnd for more than 4 wks\nB. Severity of symptoms\n\u201cMild\u201d means that\nnone\nof the following items are present:\n\u25cb\nVision disturbance\n\u25cb\nImpairment of daily activities, leisure, and/or sport\n\u25cb\nImpairment of school or work\n\u25cb\nTroublesome symptoms\n\u201cModerate\u201d means that\none\nof the following items is present:\n\u25cb\nVision disturbance\n\u25cb\nImpairment of daily activities, leisure, and/or sport\n\u25cb\nImpairment of school or work\n\u25cb\nTroublesome symptoms\n\u201cSevere\u201d means that\ntwo or more\nof the following items are present:\n\u25cb\nVision disturbance\n\u25cb\nImpairment of daily activities, leisure, and/or sport\n\u25cb\nImpairment of school or work\n\u25cb\nTroublesome symptoms\nThe items vision disturbance, impairment of daily activities/leisure/sport, impairment\n                           of school or work activities, and troublesome symptoms are quoted \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d According\n                           to the number of items affected, the disease is considered \u201cmild\u201d (0 items affected),\n                           \u201cmoderate\u201d (1 item), or \u201csevere\u201d (2\u20104 items).\n5.2.4 Scores for evaluating therapy\nThe recent recommendations for the standardization of clinical outcomes used in allergen\n                  immunotherapy trials for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (RC)\n18\nsuggested a homogeneous terminology for nasal and conjunctival symptoms using six\n                  organ\u2010related categories (itchy nose, sneezing, runny nose, blocked nose, itchy/red\n                  eyes, watery eyes) in the daily symptom score (dSS); a stepwise use of rescue medication\n                  added in the daily medication score (dMS); and a scoring system for a combined symptom\n                  and medication score (CSMS), based on an equal weight of the dSS and of the dMS. This\n                  scoring system follows the EMA guideline and the World Allergy Organization (WAO)\n                  recommendations.\n19\n,\n20\n5.2.5 QoL evaluation and questionnaires\nGeneric QoL questionnaires assessing the global health status, like the Short Form\n                  36 and 20 (SF\u201036 and SF\u201020), the EuroQoL (EQ\u20105D), and the Sickness Impact Profile\n                  (SIP)\n21\nor the KINDL questionnaire in children,\n22\nare the most frequently used.\n5.2.6 QoL in OA\nIn the absence of specific questionnaires for OA, those validated for RC can be used:\n                  the Juniper's questionnaire (RQLQ)\n23\n; its shortened version (mini\u2010RQLQ)\n24\n; and specific questionnaires for adolescents and children.\n25\n,\n26\nThe RQLQ includes 28 items divided among eight domains. The mini\u2010RQLQ has been reduced\n                  to 14 items and 5 domains: activity limitations, practical problems, nasal symptoms,\n                  ocular symptoms, and other symptoms. OA is addressed in five symptoms in the RQLQ\n                  and four in the mini\u2010RQLQ: need to rub nose/eyes, itchy eyes, sore eyes, watery eyes,\n                  and swollen eyes. Interestingly, the analysis of four clinical trials revealed that\n                  the highest scoring items were the \u201cneed to rub eye/nose\u201d and \u201citchy eyes\u201d.\n24\nIn a large cohort of 1009 rhinitis patients, the presence of ocular symptoms statistically\n                  increased the RQLQ score by +0.5.\n27\nThe smallest improvement in RQLQ score considered worthwhile by a patient affected\n                  by grass\u2010pollen allergic RC was consistently estimated as 1.\n28\nVKC and AKC should probably be considered separately, because the impact on QoL is\n                  often intense. The QUICK questionnaire, developed for VKC,\n16\ncontains 16 items pooled in two domains: symptoms; and daily activities. In contrast\n                  to children with RC,\n26\ndaily activities (going to the swimming pool, practicing sports, meeting friends)\n                  were significantly impacted by VKC.\n5.2.7 Impact on economic costs\nSAC patients experienced QoL reductions in general health and specific aspects of\n                  vision and productivity, but also a significant economic cost to treat their condition\n                  when assessed by the Health Economic and Demographic Questionnaire (HEDQ).\n29\nThis aspect must be taken into account for both private and public healthcare modalities\n                  when attempting to ascribe a total cost to a medical condition.\n5.3 Recommendations\nScore signs and symptoms for diagnosis and monitoring.\nUse VAS system to evaluate patients\u2019 perspective.\nAssess the OA impact on QoL.\nUse EuroQoL (EQ\u20105D) to gain basic information on general QoL.\nIn the absence of a specific questionnaire on OA, use the mini\u2010RQLQ.\nQUICK is the only specific and validated questionnaire for VKC.\n5.4 Unmet needs\nCorrelation among currently available severity scoring systems is unknown.\nSpecific QoL questionnaires should be developed to study the impact of OA on vision,\n                     general and psychological condition in different ages.\nAn ideal tool could measure disease, symptoms perception, and treatment efficacy by\n                     the patient.\n6 Allergy Testing in OA\n6.1 Rationale and definitions\nDuring the process of diagnosing OA, the allergen may be considered as either the\n               main trigger of symptoms, closely associated with nonallergenic factors, or unrelated\n               to clinical symptoms. The relationship between allergen sensitivity and allergen exposure\n               is easy to assess, particularly in SAC. Allergen investigations may be unnecessary\n               in cases where symptoms resolve with symptomatic treatment, or when symptoms occur\n               after an obvious allergen exposure. If symptoms persist or recur regardless of treatment,\n               allergen identification is required. In the majority of cases, skin prick tests (SPTs)\n               are unanimously considered the gold standard and the first\u2010line approach for identifying\n               IgE\u2010mediated sensitization, due to their efficiency, safety, and relatively low cost.\n30\nBiological assays such as specific IgE measurement are used to confirm sensitization\n               in specific cases. Nevertheless, polysensitization (eg., a sensitization\u2014as confirmed\n               by SPTs or ssIgE assays\u2014to two or more allergens) is often found in patients with\n               allergic rhinitis.\n31\nOnce sensitization is demonstrated, its relevance for the patient can be investigated\n               by the more specific conjunctival allergen provocation test (CAPT), particularly when\n               polyallergy (eg., clinical response to two or more allergens) is suspected or when\n               clinical history suggests OA but SPT and IgE are negative or inconclusive.\n1\n,\n31\n-\n33\nProcedures, indications, and limitations of CAPT have been recently described.\n32\nWhen medical history suggests contact allergy, non\u2010IgE\u2010mediated test is relevant,\n               especially in cases of CBC.\n10\n6.2 Techniques\nThe SPT should be performed with airway allergens and be read according to rigorous\n               methodology, according to EAACI recommendations.\n34\n,\n35\nIndications for intradermal tests are limited to selected cases and allergens.\nSerum allergen\u2010specific IgE measurements detect IgE sensitization over 0.1 IU/mL,\n               although low levels (<0.35 IU/mL) are less likely to be clinically relevant, are less\n               sensitive than SPT,\n31\n,\n36\nand are not mandatory when SPT correlates with clinical history. Local sensitization\n               may be suspected in OA; therefore, microarray measurements of specific IgE in tears\n               may be helpful.\n37\n,\n38\nComparing serum and tear total IgE levels could be considered an indirect method\n               for evidencing local allergy.\n37\nThe component\u2010resolved diagnosis (CRD), based on the pure allergen molecules (microarray\n               or recombinant allergen\u2010specific IgE detection), may be helpful in polysensitized\n               or polyallergic patients. It can identify IgE antibody responses to cross\u2010reactive\n               allergens present in foods and pollens and identify genuine primary sensitization,\n               which is not possible with the use of allergen extracts. However, it is still rarely\n               used in routine patient testing.\n39\n,\n40\nThe CAPT evaluates the inflammatory effects on the conjunctiva after topical allergen\n               application\n1\n,\n32\ntriggering the same signs (redness, chemosis, and lid swelling) and symptoms (itching\n               and tearing) as those of a natural allergen exposure. Contraindications are limited\n               to uncontrolled allergy and chronic diseases. It requires an ophthalmic examination\n               to rule out any ocular inflammation and a controlled protocol based on positivity\n               criteria. Itching and redness are the main criteria to achieve a positive response\n               when scored 2+(Appendix\nS1\n).\n41\nThe IGOA TF on CAPT recommends the use of total ocular symptom score (TOSS; range\n               0\u201013) considered positive when it reaches 5.\n32\nBoth early and late allergic responses can be monitored. As CAPT may induce nasal\n               symptoms, scoring them is useful. However, there is a lack of a standardized method\n               for evaluating the combined ocular and nasal symptoms. Nonspecific challenge tests\n               are only used for research purposes.\nPatch tests aim to explore non\u2010IgE\u2010mediated allergy.\n42\nHaptens involved may be preservatives or additives in eye drops, cosmetics, or professional\n               allergens.\n6.3 Recommendations\nIf SPT, IgE levels, and allergen exposure history are in concordance, the involvement\n                     of an allergen can be assumed in SAC and PAC.\nCAPT should be considered in polysensitized or suspected polyallergic patients.\nCAPT is recommended when medical history suggests an allergen sensitization but SPTs\n                     are negative.\nIn VKC and AKC, allergen\u2010specific triggering is less frequently involved.\nPatch tests are required in CBC.\n6.4 Unmet needs\nStandardized methods for evaluating the ocular and nasal symptoms in response to CPT\n                     or NPT.\nStandardized specific IgE analysis for small tear volumes.\n7 Visual Function\n7.1 Rationale and definition\nOA is not considered as a sight\u2010threatening disorder. However, the clinical presentation\n               ranges from mild forms not (or only slightly) influencing visual acuity (VA) to severe\n               diseases (VKC and AKC), which affect the ocular structures, VA, and QoL. Complications\n               (corneal impairment, irregular astigmatism and scars, keratoconus, cataract, steroid\u2010induced\n               glaucoma) result in visual impairment.\n43\nVisual disturbances are also caused by symptoms (intense itching, watering, foreign\n               body sensation, mucus discharge, eyelid pseudoptosis, ocular pain, and photophobia).\n               Few population\u2010based data on VA impairment in OA are available as VA rarely represents\n               a primary or secondary outcome in clinical trials.\n7.2 Techniques\nVA is measured by asking the subject to discriminate letters of known visual angle\n               (Snellen and derived optotypes) or letters of equal recognition difficulty. The log\n               of the minimal angle of resolution at a given distance and at high contrast (ETDRS\n               and similar) uses an eye chart (optical instruments or computerized tests) at standard\n               conditions. As VA sometimes is difficult to measure in active VKC and AKC, QoL can\n               be quantified as a surrogate criterion,\n44\nbut improves depending on the severity of corneal involvement.\n45\nAll VKC and AKC patients should routinely undergo topographic corneal assessment\n               because of the higher incidence of keratoconus.\n46\n,\n47\n7.3 Recommendations\nConsider visual acuity assessment in daily practice.\nVKC and AKC subjects should undergo topographic corneal examination to rule out keratoconus.\n8 Ocular Surface Evaluation (Tear Film Function)\n8.1 Rationale and definition\nOcular allergy and dry eye syndrome are the most common ocular surface inflammatory\n               disorders. One does not preclude the coexistence of the other.\n48\nChronic OA is causative of dry eye, which is classified as hyposecretory (reduced\n               tear production) or evaporative (due to low tear lipid layer thickness related to\n               MGD).\n49\nTear film instability was found in atopic children affected by not only allergic\n               conjunctivitis but also rhinitis and asthma.\n50\nSimple tear film\u2010evaluating tests should be performed by ophthalmologists.\n8.2 Techniques\nInvasive breakup time (BUT)\n: Insert a presoaked fluorescein strip in the inferior conjunctival fornix, and remove\n               when tears are stained. Use blue cobalt light +/\u2212 yellow filter for observation. After\n               a few blinks, measure time between the last complete blink and tear film break (when\n               black striae appear in the precorneal tear film). Repeat the measurement three times.\n               Mean values below 10 seconds reflect tear instability.\n49\nSchirmer test\n: Insert a nitrocellulose Schirmer strip into the inferior conjunctival fornix, at\n               the external third of the inferior lid. Measure the length of wetted strip within\n               5 minutes. A test without anesthesia is recommended as being more reproducible. Values\n               below 5 mm reflect aqueous deficient dry eye.\n49\nTear osmolarity\ncan be measured by an osmolarimeter. The TearLab\n\u00ae\nTearLab Corp., San Diego, CA, USA device provides an immediate result after automated\n               collection of a few nanoliters. Values beyond 312 mOsm/L and interocular variability\n               of >8 mOsm/L are abnormal.\n49\nTear lipid layer thickness\ncan be measured by interferometers.\n8.3 Recommendations\nConsider tear film\u2010evaluating tests as dry eye and OA can coexist.\n9 Ocular Sampling and Tear biomarkers\n9.1 Rationale and definition\nTear specimens can be easily obtained from the ocular surface, making cytology and\n               assays for mediators potential diagnostic tools. The tear fluid is an extremely complex\n               biological mixture containing cells, proteins/peptides, electrolytes, lipids, and\n               small\u2010molecule metabolites, which can be measured for diagnostic, prognostic, and\n               experimental purposes. Tear protein analysis has been limited to a few analytical\n               techniques depending on antibody availability and the small sample size. With increasing\n               proteomic applications, tears show great potential as a source of biomarkers in the\n               development of clinical assays for various human diseases, including OA.\n9.2 Technique\nDifferent methods for tear collection can be used: capillary tube, filter paper, ophthalmic\n               sponges, and eyewashes.\n51\nAspiration of tears by glass capillary tubes can yield volumes of 20\u201050 \u03bcL. Tear\n               collection is tedious, time\u2010consuming, and uncomfortable for patients and may provoke\n               the production of reflex tears. Tears can be recovered from Schirmer's strips,\n52\ncellulose or polyurethane sponges, porous polyester, or cellulose acetate rods placed\n               in the lower tear meniscus and held for a fixed period of time.\n53\n,\n54\nFor the eyewash technique, a fixed volume of saline is instilled into the inferior\n               fornix and the fluid collected by a capillary tube\n55\n; however, it is impossible to determine the original tear volume and the dilution\n               coefficient.\nCytology\ncan be performed using tears, conjunctival scrapings, impression cytology, or biopsy.\n               For tear cytology, only a few microliters of tears is needed. Conjunctival scrapings,\n               performed with a spatula or brush, allow for the collection of epithelial and inflammatory\n               cells (if present). Precolored slides or rapid dyes can be used for a quick response.\n               Impression cytology refers to the application of a cellulose acetate filter on the\n               ocular surface to remove the superficial epithelial layers.\n56\nConjunctival biopsy (performed under topical anesthesia) is required when a neoplastic\n               pathology or autoimmune disease is suspected. Samples can be used for immunostaining,\n               flow cytometry, or RNA or DNA extraction, all depending on the number of cells collected.\nIn OA, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes can be found in tears with different\n               cellular profiles in acute and chronic phases, or after specific CPT and NPT.\n57\n,\n58\nT cells, B cells, and CD4:CD8 T\u2010cell ratios were found to be higher in AKC tears\n               than in controls,\n59\nwhile increased Th2 cells have been found in VKC tears.\n60\nTear specimens contain various enzymes and hydrolases; thus, proper storage is important\n               to prevent sample loss and/or variable results.\n61\n,\n62\nTotal and specific IgE, several mediators, cytokines, chemokines, growth factors,\n               angiogenic modulators, proteases, enzymes, and inhibitors have been identified in\n               cell\u2010free tear fluids using methods such as ELISA, RIA, multiplex bead arrays, membrane\u2010bound\n               antibody array, and proteomic techniques (see review\n63\n). Increased tear levels of IgE, tryptase, histamine, and eosinophil cationic protein\n               (ECP) have been considered biomarkers of OA.\n63\n,\n64\nProteomic analysis of tear fluid has proven to be a promising approach to gain more\n               information about the pathogenesis of diseases and lead to new diagnostic possibilities.\n65\n,\n66\nExcluding assays for total IgE and MMP\u20109 specifically designed for tears, no local\n               tests have been standardized for clinical use and probably no single factor or test\n               can be considered as a specific disease marker. More likely, a combination of them\n               may be required to indicate a single disease phenotype, activity phase, or therapeutic\n               effect.\n9.3 Recommendations\nCollect tear samples independently from both eyes because of possible asymmetrical\n                     conditions.\nPrefer capillary tube collection as cells and mediators bind to the strips or sponges.\nThe presence of one eosinophil by cytology is highly indicative of OA, whereas their\n                     absence does not exclude it.\nTear collection and storage can influence protein detection.\n9.4 Unmet need\nAn assay kit for detecting a panel of tear mediators should be validated.\n10 Imaging and Emerging Additional Tests\n10.1 Rationale\nIn vivo imaging technologies have been widely used in the diagnosis, assessment of\n               clinical severity, and follow\u2010up of ocular surface disorders. The application of these\n               technologies may help to quantify the extent of inflammation and evaluate the efficacy\n               of anti\u2010allergic agents.\n10.2 Definition and techniques\nIn vivo\nconfocal microscopy (IVCM)\nis a real\u2010time, noninvasive imaging technology, which enables microstructural analysis\n               of the cornea in more physiological conditions at a cellular level.\n67\nIVCM creates a point source of light focused by an objective lens on the tissue.\n               Compared to traditional slit lamp imaging, IVCM provides a higher magnification and\n               depth of view, but examines only a limited area. With the recent in vivo laser scanning\n               CM (LSCM), it is possible to study the microscopic anatomy of semiopaque structures,\n               such as the conjunctiva and meibomian glands (MG).\nMorphological changes of superficial epithelial cells and nerves and increased presence\n               of activated keratocytes, inflammatory cells, and Langerhans cells in the corneal\n               stroma were shown in VKC and AKC by LSCM\n68\n,\n69\n(Figure\n5\n).\nFigure 5\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nCorneal confocal microscopy in a patient affected by vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). (A) Sub\u2010basal corneal nerve plexus with adjacent dendritic cells.

(B) Anterior corneal\n                           stroma with highly reflecting cells corresponding to activated keratocytes\nFollowing CAPT, IVCM can be used to track and score the progress of the acute and\n               late\u2010phase allergic inflammation, capturing video images useful to study cell dynamics\n               (scale 0\u20104; patent pending).\n70\nIVCM may become useful for evaluating the efficacy of anti\u2010allergic medications. In\n               VKC and AKC, topical cyclosporine A (CsA) significantly reduced the density of inflammatory\n               cells.\n71\n,\n72\nMeibography\nis a noninvasive technique developed to observe MG structure. Using laser confocal\n               meibography, shortening, distortion, and dropout of MG may be observed in PAC.\n73\n,\n74\nLipid layer interferometry\nmeasures tear film stability and analyzes the depth of the lipid layer. Advanced\n               tear instability and thickening of the tear film lipid layer were found in 80% of\n               SAC patients.\n75\nPhotography\n: Conjunctival hyperemia can be evaluated on the basis of digital photographs using\n               a modified grading scale or using different digital image analysis software.\n76\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT)\nis an adjunctive, noninvasive, diagnostic method that can help the diagnosis of ocular\n               surface lesions.\n77\nHowever, it is not routinely used in OA.\n10.3 Recommendations\nUse new imaging techniques to more accurately assess the degree of inflammation in\n                     diagnosis, follow\u2010up, and treatment.\n11 Diagnostic Algorithm\nThe proposed diagnostic algorithm (Figure\n1\n) is based on the clinical expertise of the authors and relevant recommendations from\n            the literature.\n1\n,\n3\n,\n13\n,\n33\n,\n78\nThe diagnosis of a suspected OA is based on medical history and the presence of suggestive\n            signs and symptoms. In case of symptoms unusually not suggestive of OA, the differential\n            diagnosis can be made, with the assistance of an ophthalmologist, considering the\n            wide spectrum of disorders affecting the ocular surface. If signs and symptoms are\n            suggestive of OA, primary skin or in vitro testing in addition to the clinical characteristic\n            of each ocular disease (Tables\n1\nand\n2\n) will improve the diagnosis. If primary diagnostic tools are uncertain or negative,\n            secondary, more specific, local diagnostic tests may help to either define a specific\n            ocular hypersensitivity disease or lead to a proper differential diagnosis.\n12 Concluding Remarks\nCharacteristics of each diagnostic tool are summarized in Table\n4\n. Specific questionnaires on medical history and QoL for OA are still needed, and\n            the correlation among currently available severity scoring systems is largely unknown.\n            Ophthalmologists should refer their patients to the allergist any time there is a\n            suspect of a specific sensitization and/or allergic comorbidity. On the other hand,\n            allergists should refer to the ophthalmologists all patients with severe ocular signs\n            and symptoms, when ocular symptoms do not correlate with a specific sensitization\n            or to rule out other nonallergic eye disorders. It is still not clear why, in some\n            cases, the eye may be the only affected organ, or why some patients suffer from severe\n            untreatable or chronic forms of OA only. Coordinated clinical and experimental studies\n            are required to identify specific molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with\n            each subtype of OA for developing new diagnostic tools and therapies.\nTable 4.\nMain characteristics of diagnostic tools in ocular allergy\nAims\nMethods/Instruments\nRecommendations\nClinical history\nEvaluation of:\nSymptoms and severity\nComorbidities and general\nMedical condition\nMedical/surgical history\nExposure to allergens/irritants/nonspecific triggers\nVisual tasks\nTalk to patients and parents\nQuestionnaires\nAccurate medical and personal history\nRed eye differential diagnosis\nAlways ask for ocular signs and symptoms in other allergic comorbidities\nInvestigate triggers for signs and symptoms\nRefer to an ophthalmologist especially in case of ocular pain, visual disturbance,\n                                 or severe symptoms (red eye DD)\nClinical ocular examination\nTo assess specific and nonspecific signs\nObservation with and without the slit lamp\nAlways look at the eyelid skin and the lid margin\nIf you don't have a slit lamp, look at the eye using natural light when possible\nLook for severity signs\nExamination by an ophthalmologist may be required in atypical or severe cases\nScores\nEvaluation of:\nSeverity of the disease\nCAPT and NPT response\nEfficacy of treatments\nGrading signs and symptoms\nSeverity index\nScoring signs and symptoms is recommended for diagnosis and monitoring\nUse the VAS system to gain patients\u2019 perspective\nQoL\nTo assess the effects of disease on daily functioning, work, leisure, and school perceived\n                           by patient\nQuestionnaires\nConsider an assessment of impact of OA on QoL; however, a specific questionnaire is\n                                 missing\nUse EuroQoL (EQ\u20105D) to gain basic information on general QoL\nIn the absence of a specific questionnaire on ocular allergy, the mini\u2010RQLQ can be\n                                 used\nThe QUICK is the only specific and validated questionnaire for VKC\nAllergy tests\nEvaluation of the specific sensitization state\nSkin prick tests\nBlood analysis with allergen\u2010specific IgE\nPatch tests\nWhen an IgE allergic disease is suspected\nWhen contact blepharitis or blepharoconjunctivitis is suspected\nConjunctival Allergen provocation test\nEvaluation of the conjunctival response to specific allergens\nProvocation by topical allergen at fixed dilutions\nIn case of negative SPT/sIgE\nIn case of polysensitization/polyallergy\nTo evaluate desensitization\nVisual function\nTo assess best visual acuity\nOptotypes\nConsider visual acuity assessment as a primary outcome in daily practice\nVKC and AKC subjects should undergo topographic corneal examination to rule out keratoconus\nTear film function\nEvaluate tear film stability, quantity, and dynamic\nBUT\nFluorescein staining\nSchirmer test\nTear osmolarity\nMeibomian glands\nIn all patients with chronic OA\nWhen adverse environment causes symptoms\nConsider tear film\u2010evaluating tests as dry eye and OA can coexist\nOcular sampling\nObtain tear fluids, cells, and tissues for analysis\nTear collection\nCapillary tubes\nSchirmer strips\nSponges\nScrapings\nBrush\nImpression cytology\nBiopsy\nCollect samples independently from both eyes\nCapillary tube collection is preferable\nUse cytology for qualitative inflammation\nBiopsy in case of autoimmune diseases and unilateral/malignant disease\nTear biomarkers\nDisease biomarkers\nSeverity biomarkers\nPrognostic biomarkers\nELISA\nRIA\nOmics\nIn experimental and clinical studies\nDiagnostic tools in severe cases\nImaging\nTo evaluate corneal cells, nerves, and stroma\nBlood cell dynamics in conjunctiva\nMeibomian glands\nConfocal microscopy\nMeibography\nPhotography\nIn evaluating ocular surface changes\nIn experimental and clinical studies\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was done under the approval of EAACI with a TF budget 2014\u201016.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\nAuthor Contributions\nAL, JLF, LD, and VC conceived and designed the study; AL, PB, FC, ADS, ET, SC, AJC,\n            and BZ analyzed and interpreted the data; AL, SD, JLF, BB, PA, FM, CR, and MJ wrote\n            the article; LD and PH critically revised the article; AL, SD, JLF, BB, LD, and VC\n            approved the final version of the article; AL, SD, JLF, BB, PA, FM, CR, and MJ collected\n            the data.

The poorest QOL for each domain was observed in the lower and upper SES groups,\n            representing an inverse U\u2010shaped pattern of association; however, statistical significance\n            was only observed for psychological health (OR=0.5, 95%CI 0.4\u20130.7,\np\n<0.001). These relationships were similar for IEO and IER.\nConclusions\n: Men from lower and upper SES groups have lower QOL compared to their counterparts\n            in the mid SES group.\nQuality of life (QOL) is a broad and encompassing construct, defined by the World\n            Health Organization (WHO) as \u201c\u2026perceptions of [an individual's] position in life in\n            the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to\n            their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns\u201d;\n1\nthus QOL is a multifactorial construct. Adding further complexity to QOL is the acknowledgement\n            that social and personal resources, as well as physical capabilities, influence an\n            individual's ability to enjoy the highest attainable standard of wellbeing and health.\n2\nThis is recognised by the WHO as a fundamental right of every individual,\n2\nand underpins the work of the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health.\n3\n,\n4\nMaterial or economic deprivation is associated with social disadvantage, and highly\n            related to increased stress.\n5\nMore specifically, the clustering of deprivation at the neighbourhood level, or the\n            area in which we reside, impacts upon social exclusion, housing, racism, discrimination,\n            inadequate public infrastructure, and potentially less exposure to civic participation,\n            educational attainment, and choices in recreation activities.\n6\n,\n7\nSurvey data show large cross\u2010national differences in perceived happiness; curiously,\n            developing countries such as Indonesia and India scoring higher than either OECD or\n            third world countries.\n8\nTaken in context, it is evident that social disadvantage is likely to impact upon\n            QOL.\nA compelling level of evidence exists that suggests low QOL in men is associated with\n            unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, including current smoking,\n9\n,\n10\ngreater alcohol consumption,\n11\n,\n12\nphysical inactivity\n13\n,\n14\nand greater body mass index (BMI).\n15\nFurthermore, it is well documented that potentially adversary lifestyle behaviours\n            such as these are more common in socially disadvantaged individuals.\n16\n-\n24\nGiven the observed clustering of social deprivation,\n6\n,\n7\nthe application of validated measures of area\u2010based SES enables investigations to\n            examine the role played by social and economic characteristics that make up an area,\n25\nand thus influence individuals who reside within that area, on health outcomes. Given\n            the importance of socioeconomic status (SES) as a determinant of health, it is equally\n            important to understand social determinants of QOL.\nWhile an increasing body of work is beginning to employ the World Health Organization\n            Quality of Life Instruments (WHOQOL\u2010BREF) to disentangle the subjective experience\n            of QOL for those experiencing poorer health, none to date have examined this specifically\n            in relation to area\u2010based SES in population\u2010based adult men. Furthermore, there is\n            a lack of Australian data in this field of enquiry, despite a large Australian study\n            showing that those residing in affluent cities are more likely to be \u2018unhappy\u2019 compared\n            to those residing in poor regional towns.\n26\nIt is therefore necessary to clarify any association between QOL and area\u2010based SES,\n            especially in Australian men, where such data are limited. We undertook this study\n            to investigate the association between QOL, using the WHOQOL\u2010BREF, and different levels\n            of area\u2010based SES in a randomly selected, population\u2010based sample of Australian men.\nMethods\nStudy participants\nData were derived from an age\u2010stratified random, population\u2010based sample of men selected\n               from the Commonwealth electoral roll for the Barwon Statistical Division (BSD) of\n               south\u2010eastern Australia. Participants were recruited during 2001\u201306 for the Geelong\n               Osteoporosis Study (GOS); a cohort originally established to investigate the epidemiology\n               of osteoporosis in men. The population characteristics of the BSD have been shown\n               as comparable with national level.\n27\nThe initial sample totalled 1,540 men (aged 20\u201393 years, participation 67%).\n27\nFrom a potential pool of 967 men who had participated in the GOS 5\u2010year follow up\n               study 2007\u201311 (participation 81%), n=50 participants had not completed the Australian\n               WHOQOL\u2010BREF and were excluded from analyses, leaving the final number for analysis\n               at 917 (age range 24\u201392 years). The Barwon Health Human Research and Ethics Committee\n               approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nMeasures\nOutcome variable\nTo measure quality of life, we employed the WHOQOL\u2010BREF (Australian version), a subset\n                  of the WHOQOL\u2010100 assessment tool that has been shown as comprehensive, subjective,\n                  relative, and culturally relevant from the participants' perspectives.\n28\nFour domains are included in the WHOQOL\u2010BREF: physical health (facets include pain\n                  and discomfort; dependence of medical treatment; energy and fatigue; mobility; sleep\n                  and rest; activities of daily living; and work capacity), psychological health (facets\n                  include positive and negative affect; spirituality; thinking and concentration; body\n                  image and appearance; and self\u2010esteem), social relationships (facets include personal\n                  relationships; sexual activity; social support), and environment (facets include physical\n                  safety and security; pollution and traffic; financial resources; opportunities to\n                  acquire new skills; participation in recreation activities; home environment; access\n                  to quality health and social care; and transportation). The WHOQOL\u2010BREF has been widely\n                  field\u2010tested and validated by further studies,\n28\nand shown to have excellent test\u2010retest reliability at <0.8, internal consistency\n                  between 0.60\u20130.90, and high correlations for both construct and discriminant validity.\n28\nQOL domain scores were transformed in accordance with the WHO guidelines.\n28\nFor analyses, we dichotomised the QOL domain scores at the median score to indicate\n                  dissatisfaction with psychological health (\u226481), physical health (\u226475), social relationships\n                  (\u226475), and the environment (\u226481).\nExposure variables\nThe residential address of each participant was matched to the corresponding Australian\n                  Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census Collection District (an area encompassing about\n                  250 households). ABS software was used to determine the Socio\u2010Economic Indexes for\n                  Areas (SEIFA) value from the 2006 census for each participant. SEIFA indices summarise\n                  the average characteristics of participants within an area, and provide a single measure\n                  to rank the level of advantage and disadvantage at the area level, not of the individual.\n29\nThe SEIFA indices were validated by analysts from the ABS Regional Offices, and academic\n                  and policy research experts, skilled in socioeconomic modelling and analysis, peer\u2010reviewed\n                  the variables and methodology employed in SEIFA 2006,\n29\nas previously reported.\n6\nWe have previously reported on the validation of the SEIFA indices.\n6\nWe determined\na priori\nto apply the three SEIFA indices which are equivalised for both advantage and disadvantage,\n                  to enable the encompassing the entire socioeconomic continuum: the Index of Relative\n                  Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage (IRSAD), the Index of Economic Resources\n                  (IER), and the Index of Education and Occupation (IEO).\n29\nThe IRSAD includes high and low income, type of occupation from unskilled employment\n                  to professional positions. The IER measures variables in relation to annual household\n                  income, rental and mortgage payments, and dwelling size. The IEO includes measures\n                  of the proportion of employed individuals, their level of educational attainment,\n                  and the type of occupation held. Based on SEIFA values of the study population, subjects\n                  were categorised into quintiles according to the cut points of the BSD determined\n                  by 2006 Australian Census Data.\n29\nTo address power issues, quintiles 1 and 2 were pooled to form the lower SES group\n                  (35.7% of our sample, based on IRSAD) while quintiles 4 and 5 were pooled to form\n                  the upper SES group (44.9% of our sample, based on IRSAD) and quintile 3 was held\n                  as referent.\nBody weight and height were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm, respectively,\n                  from which BMI was determined by weight/height\u00b2 (kg/m\u00b2). Alcohol intake was ascertained\n                  by a validated food frequency questionnaire and documented in grams per day.\n30\nPhysical activity was assessed by self\u2010report questionnaire; participants were determined\n                  to be physically active if vigorous to light exercise was undertaken on a regular\n                  basis. All measures were current at the time that the WHOQOL\u2010BREF was completed.\nStatistics\nDifferences in characteristics across each SES group (lower, mid and upper), measured\n                  by the three SEIFA indices (IRSAD, IEO, and IEO), were tested using Kruskal\u2010Wallis\n                  and chi\u2010square tests, where appropriate. Odds ratios (OR with 95% confidence intervals)\n                  were determined using logistic regression models to examine the association between\n                  QOL and SES, holding the mid\u2010SES group as referent. Age, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption\n                  and physical activity were tested for inclusion in the models; age was included as\n                  a confounder in the final models, with a further adjustment made for the mediating\n                  effects of physical activity in the domains of psychological health, social relationships,\n                  and environment. All statistical analyses were performed using Minitab (Version 15;\n                  Minitab, State College, PA).\nResults\nCharacteristics for each SES group (lower, mid and upper) as measured by three SEIFA\n            indices (IER, IEO and IRSAD) are presented in\nTable 1\n. Differences were identified across the three SES groups for each of the SEIFA indices\n            in regards to age, alcohol, and smoking status, and the QOL domains, physical health,\n            psychological health and environment. Differences were also seen across the three\n            SES groups for IRSAD and IEO in regards to physical activity. No differences were\n            observed for the QOL domain of social relationships across any SES group or for any\n            SEIFA index.\nTable 1.\nSubject characteristics (n=917) across lower, mid and upper SES groups, measured by\n               SEIFA indices of IRSAD, IER, and IEO.

Men of lower SES are significantly more likely to report dissatisfaction with their\n            psychological health, physical health and environment, compared to men of mid and\n            upper SES.\n2. Men of upper SES also reported greater dissatisfaction with the QOL domains of\n            psychological health, physical health and environment compared to men in the mid\u2010SES\n            group, however, that disparity was not as great as observed for men of lower SES.\n3. No associations were observed between SES and QOL social relationships.\n4. An inverse U\u2010shape pattern of association was observed between SES and QOL in the\n            domains of psychological health, physical health and the environment, consistent for\n            each SEIFA index, suggesting that individuals from both ends of the SES spectrum are\n            likely to report poorer QOL compared to individuals in the mid SES group.\nIn light of a paucity of data using the WHOQOL\u2010BREF, our current understanding is\n            limited; thus, we provide a speculative discussion focused on each of the QOL domains.\nPhysical health\nThe importance of satisfaction with physical health cannot be overestimated, especially\n               given that functional capacity (an element of physical health) is a key risk factor\n               shown to increase the likelihood of depression in population\u2010based individuals without\n               chronic disease,\n31\nas well as those with chronic disease, such as lung cancer.\n32\nImportantly, the domain of physical health measured by the WHOQOL\u2010BREF has been shown\n               by other studies to correlate significantly with clinical variables such as haemoglobin\n               levels and serum lactate dehydrogenase.\n33\nPrevious studies have reported that a greater number of co\u2010morbidities have been\n               associated with poorer QOL, such as a study from Turkey which employed the Nottingham\n               Health Profile to examine QOL,\n34\nand a German study of patients with diabetes which employed the EQ\u20105D tool.\n35\nOur findings are consistent with previously observed relationships, and with the\n               fact that we have previously reported a greater number of co\u2010morbidities in men from\n               lower SES in this randomly selected sample.\n36\nHowever, we also observed a lower QOL for men of upper SES; an association recently\n               reported to exist for Canadian women where SES was measured by household\u2010size\u2010adjusted\n               income.\n37\nWhile there is a relative paucity of data examining QOL in Australian men, we speculate\n               that men of upper SES may be more self\u2010critical and have greater expectations of better\n               physical health; factors potentially related to their greater educational attainment\n               and thus a tendency for higher self\u2010imposed standards of achievement.\nPsychological health\nWe are unable to comment on whether self\u2010reported dissatisfaction with QOL associated\n               with psychological health suggests an impaired perception, or whether the reported\n               QOL in this domain reflects actual mental health status. However, we have previously\n               reported a similar inverse U\u2010shape pattern of association in females when examining\n               the relationship between SES and mood disorders measured by a gold standard clinical\n               assessment tool.\n6\nLower\u2010rated psychological health in men of lower SES may not be surprising, especially\n               given the well\u2010documented association between social disadvantage and poorer health\n               in general, often referred to as the social gradient of health.\n3\n,\n38\nThis is both a clinical and public health concern, especially in an era where mental\n               health problems are one of the most common causes of disability and highest contributors\n               to the overall disease burden.\n39\n,\n40\nSimilarly, dissatisfaction with psychological health among men of upper SES was observed;\n               contrary to the social gradient of health theory. Men of upper SES may have distinct\n               stressors which may influence their psychological health, such as potential over\u2010indebtedness\n               or work life balance choices.\n6\n,\n41\nPeople at the ends of the income spectrum may also feel more marginalised from the\n               norm, and perceived social cohesion may be an operative factor. Indeed, our findings\n               are consistent with a study of 23,000 Australians which suggested that the \u2018saddest\u2019\n               people resided in more affluent areas, such as Sydney, while the \u2018happiest\u2019 people\n               resided in poorer regional towns.\n26\nThis is also concordant with cross\u2010national surveys of happiness, where middle\u2010income\n               countries score highest. Our data suggest that there may be a need to improve accessibility\n               to programs and services associated with psychological health, with specific attention\n               directed toward increasing the acceptability of these services by men. Furthermore,\n               and more specific to men, there is a paucity of data examining underlying mechanisms\n               which may influence the observed associations; a concern in light of the increasing\n               burden associated with psychological illness.\nSocial relationships\nThe absence of significant differences in QOL for the domain of social relationships\n               between SES groups, consistent for each of the SEIFA indices, suggests that there\n               may be a shared \u2018norm\u2019 for social relationships within different communities. A shared\n               \u2018norm\u2019 may suggest that within the social fabric of populated areas we should acknowledge\n               the intrinsic value of perception of satisfaction with their neighbourhoods or communities.\n25\nIndeed, there are suggestions that the characteristics of an area in which an individual\n               resides may influence health outcomes independently of individual behaviours.\n25\nWhether or not this is perceived equality, or real equality, is irrelevant when considering\n               subjective QOL. Importantly, our findings compare favourably with another study that\n               examined social relationships;\n42\nan observation suggested as a result of fewer items being used to form the social\n               relationships domain of QOL. QOL and SES are complex concepts therefore the explanation\n               for a lack of differences between self\u2010reported satisfaction with social relationships\n               for men regardless of SES warrants further study as an antecedent to fully understanding\n               this association.\nEnvironment\nWe report that men from both ends of the SES continuum are dissatisfied with their\n               QOL in the domain of environment, when compared to the mid\u2010SES group. Compared to\n               the other QOL domains, the environment encompasses more concrete factors such as possessions\n               and the external environment, as opposed to the individual factors of psychological\n               and physical health, and personal relationships with others.\nWe may expect dissatisfaction with environment QOL for individuals residing in areas\n               of lower SES, given the increased likelihood of poorer\u2010quality housing options, less\n               integrated public infrastructure and potentially fewer choices of health services.\n6\n,\n7\nHowever, it may be speculated that males of upper SES would report dissatisfaction\n               with their surroundings due to pressure to \u2018keep up with Joneses\u2019 (a phenomena related\n               to the objective standard of living) or the \u2018progress paradigm\u2019 (despite relative\n               secure living standards, feeling that there is a lack of significance in life).\n43\nFurthermore, it has been reported elsewhere that income level is negatively related\n               to QOL for full\u2010time, high\u2010income male employees,\n44\nsupporting our findings in this current study. The theory of \u2018masculinity\u2019,\n45\n,\n46\nwhich addresses the concepts of hegemony, subordination, complicity and marginalisation,\n               may provide a somewhat controversial explanation for our findings; it is plausible\n               that the role taken on by the male to provide for his family (or self alone) may be\n               an underlying mechanism, whereby he may consider the ideal environment for himself,\n               and perhaps his family, to be \u2018better\u2019 than the one they currently experience. However,\n               further work is required to understand QOL in the environment domain as related to\n               the provision of housing (primarily the responsibility of the individual), and the\n               affordability of housing (primarily related to economic, market, and policy issues\n               of the country at question).\n47\nWhile our speculations regarding the environment are intrinsically linked to psychological\n               health, and potentially the other domains of physical health and social relationships,\n               it is plausible that men from different ends of the SES continuum may experience diverse\n               barriers to being satisfied with all four domains of QOL.\nStrengths and limitations\nOur study has strengths. The WHOQOL\u2010BREF is an internationally validated tool,\n42\nand is shown to be easily administered and practical for use in epidemiological research.\n28\nThe WHOQOL\u2010BREF assesses the subjective QOL in various domains encompassing health\u2010related\n               and environmental issues, thereby covering diverse aspects of life circumstances.\n               We have a high participation rate, which is atypical for a population\u2010based cohort\n               of adult males. With the exception of the social relationships domain, there was a\n               consistent inverse U\u2010shape pattern of association for each QOL domain; similarly observed\n               for each SEIFA index. Importantly, this pattern of association for subjective QOL\n               replicates the pattern of association previously observed within a cohort of population\u2010based\n               adult females from the same geographic location between clinically diagnosed mood\n               disorders using the SCID\u2010I/NP.\n6\nArea\u2010based scores of SES have been suggested as an accepted proxy for public health\n               purposes,\n48\n,\n49\nand the three SEIFA indices used for this analysis were formulated from various aggregate\n               measures, providing a robust approach to examining the association between SES and\n               QOL. Our findings also suggest that application of the WHOQOL\u2010BREF in the clinical\n               setting may assist in the early detection of healthcare needs in males; a subgroup\n               of the general population less likely to disclose distressing or personal information\n               compared to females.\n50\nThis study also has limitations. The WHOQOL\u2010BREF is not necessarily optimised for\n               all ethnic communities within Australia;\n28\nhowever, the version employed for our study has been developed specifically for the\n               Australian context, is validated, and is currently the best tool available for these\n               purposes. In light of there being no recommended cut\u2010off score for use with the WHOQOL\u2010BREF,\n               we have used the median as the cut\u2010off to indicate poorer QOL. However, we acknowledge\n               problems using the cut\u2010off point to identify participants who may be at risk of reporting\n               dissatisfaction with their QOL. For instance, it is possible that the average score\n               for good QOL may fall between 70% and 80% of the maximum (aggregated) score. This\n               potentially suggests that an appropriate cut\u2010point for our sample of adult males may\n               be greater than our median scores employed for our study. Due to the dynamic interplay\n               between the domains of QOL measured by the WHOQOL\u2010BREF, we do not suggest that subjective\n               QOL for one domain exists in isolation from the others. The response for the male\n               cohort of GOS was 67%, which may limit the representativeness of the broader Australian\n               population. The cross\u2010sectional nature of our study negates our ability to examine\n               the change or stability of QOL in men over time, however further research should focus\n               toward examining associations between SES and the consistency in QOL for population\u2010based\n               men. Finally, in using area\u2010based aggregate scores of social disadvantage, we assume\n               that relatively advantaged individuals may reside in an area that scored low on the\n               SEIFA, and that relatively disadvantaged individuals may reside in an area that scored\n               high on the SEIFA. Given that we did not account for parameters of SES measured at\n               the individual\u2010level, we are unable to comment on any dose\u2010response associations between\n               QOL and, for instance, educational attainment, income, or type of occupation or employment\n               status; however, the application of area\u2010based measures of SES in this current study\n               was informed by the theoretical argument underpinning the specific research question\n               at hand.\nThis study is the first to examine the association between social disadvantage and\n               QOL in population\u2010based Australian males using the WHOQOL\u2010BREF. We conclude that males\n               from both ends of the SES continuum may have a lower QOL compared to males in the\n               mid\u2010SES group. Potentially, unique barriers to achieving satisfaction with their QOL\n               may exist for males from each end of the SES continuum. Examining the subjective QOL\n               in the domains of psychological and physical health provides information beyond symptoms,\n               and enables the identification of otherwise undetectable health problems. Similarly,\n               examining QOL in the domains of social relationships and environments enables the\n               development of specific programs and support services to be efficiently targeted.\n               However, given that SES and QOL are complex concepts, it is imperative that further\n               research examines the role played by SES upon subjective QOL, especially in population\u2010based\n               males, and to further elucidate this area of enquiry.\nAcknowledgements\nThe study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of\n            Australia.

There are a number of instruments\n         available to measure outcome in dermatological conditions but none have been developed\n         specifically for AD. In addition, most measure symptoms and/or daily functioning,\n         which are potential influences on quality of life (QoL) rather than assessments of\n         the construct itself.\nObjectives\nThe aim of the current study was to develop a new instrument specifically designed\n         to measure QoL in adults with AD\u2014the Quality of Life Index for Atopic Dermatitis (QoLIAD).\nMethods\nThe instrument was developed based on the needs\u2010based model of QoL and was produced\n         in several different countries simultaneously. Its content was derived from 65 in\u2010depth\n         interviews with relevant patients in the U.K., Italy and the Netherlands. The initial\n         version of the measure was produced in U.K. English and translations were produced\n         for the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, France and the U.S.A. using a dual translation\n         panel methodology. A Spanish version was developed using the same adaptation process\n         after the instrument was finalized. Field\u2010test interviews were conducted with approximately\n         20 patients in each country to assess face and content validity. The instrument [in\n         addition to the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the Psychological General\n         Well\u2010Being Schedule (PGWB)] was then administered to up to 300 AD patients in each\n         country at two time points to finalize the instrument and test its psychometric properties.\nResults\nThe initial version of the QoLIAD had 56 items that reflected the areas of need fulfilment\n         identified in the qualitative interviews as having been affected by AD: mental and\n         emotional stimulation, physical and emotional stability, security, sharing and belonging,\n         self\u2010esteem, personal development and fulfilment. Comments from patients in field\u2010test\n         interviews resulted in the removal of 14 items, to leave a 42\u2010item instrument that\n         was considered relevant and acceptable. The number of patients participating in the\n         survey were 286 in the U.K., 46 in the Netherlands, 213 in France, 187 in Germany,\n         178 in the U.S.A. and 83 in Spain. Application of the Rasch model to these data identified\n         the final 25\u2010item QoLIAD. Unidimensionality was confirmed, with deviation of the total\n         scale from the Rasch model evident at a single time point in one country only (the\n         U.K.). All language versions, with the exception of the Dutch measure, had test\u2013retest\n         reliability coefficients in excess of 0\u00b785. The test\u2013retest in the Netherlands was\n         0\u00b780. However, this country had the smallest sample size and the corresponding reliability\n         for the DLQI was only 0\u00b740.

Two major influences on dyspnea were described\n            as individual exertion and exposure to environmental factors. Patients described a\n            sense of dyspnea\u2010related fear, and reported distress over the impact of dyspnea on\n            health and activity limitation. They emphasized coping via behavioral strategies and\n            medication, and reported that dyspnea caused the stopping or scaling back of activities,\n            taking more time to do things and using adaptive measures or equipment. No existing\n            model of dyspnea in COPD incorporated all of these concepts. We, therefore, developed\n            a dyspnea\u2010specific conceptual model in which the most proximal of concepts (dyspnea\n            symptoms) can impair function and are mediated by personal and environmental factors.\nConclusion:\nPatient and expert input guided the development of a comprehensive dyspnea\u2010specific\n            conceptual model for COPD which will inform the design of future patient\u2010reported\n            outcome measurement tools used to assess dyspnea and related functional limitations.\nBackground\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem in the\n            United States and around the world. Estimates of the number of US patients affected\n            by COPD range from 10 million to 24.5 million\n1\n. It is currently the fourth cause of death in the United States, and a significant\n            degree of health\u2010care utilization is attributed to it, including some 726,000 hospitalizations,\n            1.5 million visits to the emergency room, and approximately 8 million outpatient physician\n            visits. COPD is also a major source of disability and impaired health\u2010related quality\n            of life (HRQL)\n2\n.\nCOPD has been characterized by the existence of chronic bronchitis or emphysema, which\n            may contribute to airflow obstruction\n3\n. COPD evaluations in both clinical and research settings typically include both pulmonary\n            function tests (PFTs) and patient\u2010reported symptoms, which have been underlined by\n            the American Thoracic Society\n4\n, the British Thoracic Society\n5\n, and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)\n6\n. Airflow obstruction is measured with spirometry; respiratory rate and oxygenation\n            status, as measured by arterial blood gases, can also be used as COPD indicators.\n            Interestingly, these objective measures of pulmonary functioning do not correlate\n            particularly well with patients' reports of COPD\u2010associated symptoms\n7\n. The most prominent of these symptoms is dyspnea or shortness of breath. Others include\n            coughing, excess sputum production, and wheezing.\nDyspnea, like other symptoms such as pain and fatigue, is a subjective experience\n            that can only be measured from the patient's perspective, because different people\n            have different thresholds for noticing, reporting, and rating the severity of the\n            symptom. That said, patient\u2010reported dyspnea has proven difficult to measure. Although\n            several general and disease\u2010specific self\u2010report instruments have been developed,\n            criticism from research and clinical literature has highlighted an overall lack of\n            consensus and standardization\n8\n. Existing dyspnea measures utilize a wide range of administration and response formats,\n            including structured interviews\n9\n, self\u2010report questionnaires\n10\n, visual analogue scales\n11\n, and numeric rating scales\n12\n. Some focus on historical accounts of symptoms during a particular time period, while\n            others seek an estimation of dyspnea\u2010related impairment as a result of activities\n            of daily living (ADLs) or induced by exercise\n8\n. Further, many existing measures are limited\n8\n,\n13\nwith drawbacks that include: 1) under evaluation of important aspects of dyspnea,\n            such as psychological and functional factors; 2) reliance on open\u2010ended and potentially\n            biased interviewer\u2010led questions; 3) being time and labor intensive; 4) having confusing\n            instructions and scoring; 5) being unreliable and insensitive; and 6) not accounting\n            for activity modification and exertion.\nThe sheer range of different self\u2010report measurement approaches, in combination with\n            the general lack of association between self\u2010reported dyspnea and PFTs, underscores\n            the need for a conceptual model to elucidate the relationships between dyspnea and\n            other important factors that not only influence it, but are also influenced by it.\n            Once these relationships are identified and better understood, maybe then improvements\n            can be made to the manner in which dyspnea is assessed.\nImportance of Starting with a Conceptual Model\nA conceptual model is a theoretical representation which defines the concepts of interest,\n               their interfaces, and possible determinants\n14\n. A conceptual model also lends structure, content, coherence, and plausibility to\n               the concepts being measured. In developing a patient\u2010reported outcome (PRO) measure\n               of dyspnea for people diagnosed with COPD, it is important that the instrument: 1)\n               be relevant and meaningful to patients; 2) be conceptually grounded in the many factors\n               at play in the experience of dyspnea; and 3) be embedded within a specific conceptual\n               model that indicates the relationship between the patient\u2010focused outcomes and the\n               other clinical trial assessments. This article summarizes research activity surrounding\n               the articulation of patient\u2010driven concepts dealing with dyspnea and related functional\n               limitations in patients with COPD.\nMethods and Results\nUnlike positivistic research, qualitative studies involving naturalistic inquiry often\n            utilize an iterative approach to data collection, synthesis, and analysis\n15\n. As such, we have presented our Methods and Results sections jointly, to best accommodate\n            this frequentative format. This study was approved by the local institutional review\n            board of the participating research site. Our first task was to identify key concepts\n            that can clearly and closely be linked to COPD and its treatment. To elucidate and\n            focus these concepts, we conducted individual open\u2010ended interviews with people diagnosed\n            with COPD using a snowball sampling technique. As a component of grounded theory methodology\n16\n,\n17\n, interview responses were examined systematically\n18\n-\n20\n. Audiotapes of interviews were transcribed verbatim, excluding identifying information.\n            Experts were convened to generate a mutually agreeable list of themes and dimensions\n            of major ideas that were expressed by interviewees, contained in observation notes,\n            or are predefined dimensions based on current available literature. Using selective\n            coding and constant comparative methods, members of the study team participated in\n            a nominal group process to identify common themes, create definitions, and develop\n            coding rules regarding specific group comments. The comments were then compiled and\n            summarized in frequency tables denoting the number of times certain responses were\n            made. Next, these concepts were reviewed by additional patients diagnosed with COPD\n            through \u201cthink\u2010aloud interviews\u201d\n21\n, which were designed to capture patient understanding and relevance of concepts that\n            populated the evolving draft conceptual model. Data saturation had occurred during\n            the first 15 open\u2010ended interviews, which was evidenced by replication and redundancy\n22\nof major concepts and meta\u2010themes that later populated the model. Consistent with\n            recommended methods for determining saturation\n23\n, our criterion for a \u201csaturated concept\u201d was met when it was mentioned by at least\n            70% of the sample, which was achieved (the majority of concepts were mentioned by\n            more than 80% of respondents). These results were further confirmed during the second\n            round of \u201cthink\u2010aloud interviews.\u201d The result of these tasks led to the development\n            of a dyspnea\u2010specific conceptual model as it relates to the patient experience with\n            COPD. The development process is outlined in\nFigure\u20031\n. Details regarding procedure and results follow.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nConceptual model development process.\nCaption\nConceptual model development process.\nConcept Identification\nOpen\u2010ended individual patient interviews.\nPatients with COPD were identified and recruited by a medical team member from pulmonology,\n                  and COPD clinics and pulmonary function labs within a large midwestern teaching hospital\n                  system. A trained research assistant conducted face\u2010to\u2010face individual interviews,\n                  which were audio recorded and later transcribed. The patients began by answering the\n                  following open\u2010ended questions: 1) \u201cWhat does \u2018shortness of breath\u2019 mean to you?\u201d\n                  2) \u201cWhat makes your shortness of breath worse?\u201d 3) \u201cWhat makes your shortness of breath\n                  better?\u201d 4) \u201cMany people find shortness of breath to be distressing. How does shortness\n                  of breath affect you on that level?\u201d 5) \u201cWhen you think about shortness of breath,\n                  what limitations to your life or daily activities come to mind?\u201d 6) \u201cWhen you thought\n                  about limitations in the previous question, how were you limited?\u201d\nFifteen COPD patients participated in open\u2010ended individual interviews. The majority\n                  of the participants were males (80%) with a mean age of 81 (range\u2003=\u200372\u201392). All but\n                  one participant was Caucasian, and most (67%) were married. All but two participants\n                  attended at least some college and nearly all were retired (87%). The average number\n                  of years diagnosed with COPD was 14 (SD 14). The average GOLD standard was 4.7 (SD\n                  1.0), and all reported a positive smoking history (mean\u2003=\u200346 pack years, SD 16) with\n                  only two current smokers.\nExpert input.\nWe employed two expert panels to support our concept identification process. Expert\n                  panel I provided assistance with the thematic analysis of individual interview data.\n                  This panel reviewed and organized the individual interview data into meaningful units,\n                  and then grouped the patient\u2010generated themes into larger concepts, which became the\n                  foundation of the dyspnea\u2010specific conceptual model. Expert panel II provided assistance\n                  and input into the model, including review of concepts for their relevance and fit\n                  to the clinical setting of COPD. A subset of panel II experts completed a survey with\n                  test items that were derived from evolving concepts to remark on the item's importance.\n                  Experts participated in several face\u2010to\u2010face and telephone meetings as needed to reconcile\n                  the qualitative data from patients and contribute to the substance of the evolving\n                  conceptual model.\nExpert panel I (n\u2003=\u20036) included one US\u2010based clinical COPD expert, four measurement\n                  experts with qualitative research experience, and one cross\u2010cultural expert. Expert\n                  panel II (n\u2003=\u200316) was comprised of five US\u2010based clinical COPD experts, seven international\n                  clinical COPD experts, three measurement experts, and one cross\u2010cultural measurement\n                  expert. Of these 16 expert panel members, 7 clinical experts (three US based; four\n                  international) also completed a survey of test items to comment on relevance. See\nTables\u20031\u20136\nfor patient comments that were organized into thematic concepts by outside experts\n                  and study investigators.\nTable 1.\nWhat does shortness of breath (SOB) mean to you?\nSample patient statements\nConcept\nI cannot do the activities as easily as I used to.\nActivity limitation\nInability to perform certain activities, particularly walking\nNot being able to do my normal day\u2010to\u2010day activities\nI have to stop what I am doing.\nEverything I do is limited because I am weaker.\nEverything is affected by breathing.\nEverything I do is affected except when I am lying perfectly still.\nI start panting.\nBreathlessness\nI cannot breathe.\nInability to breathe without stress\nCannot seem to get enough oxygen\nI might walk across the room and have SOB, 50\u2003ft.\nExertion\nWhen I walk up/down stairs, I breathe very heavily.\nIf I have to hurry, I get SOB.\nAny kind of exertion\nExercising\nYou cannot take full breaths.\nIncomplete breathing\nNot being able to inhale a normal breath\nI lose control of my bodily functions, such as bladder.\nLoss of different bodily functions\nBlowing my nose is impossible because of SOB.\nVery low stamina with least exertion\nLow stamina/energy\nIt wipes me out.\nEverything is tiresome.\nI associate it with my heartbeat.\nRelated to heart\nMy heartbeat becomes excessively high.\nI get relief from the meds I get from my doctors.\nTaking medications\nI have to stop and catch my breath.\nTime extension\nYou have to sit down to catch your breath until you can breathe again.\nThose things you do, you do slower because it causes SOB.\nIt is a choking sensation.\nUncomfortable sensation\nHuffing and puffing\nI have to turn up the oxygen so that I can breathe better.\nUse of assistive devices\nFirst thing you ask for is oxygen.\nTable 2.\nWhat makes your shortness of breath (SOB) worse?\nSample patient statements\nConcept\nBeing at the airport\nActivity requirements\nClimbing stairs\nDaily activities\nWalking\nTalking\nWalking on an incline\nRapid movement\nLifting\nShopping\nMaking my bed\nMaking coffee\nDoing the laundry\nGoing to the bathroom\nDoing the dishes\nSmoke has a big influence\nEnvironmental factors\nCold air\nWhen it is too hot outside\nChange of seasons\nPollen\nFreshly cut grass\nCats\nBirds make me SOB\nExertion\nExertion\nExercise\nTable 3.\nWhat makes your shortness of breath better?\nSample patient statements\nConcept\nGoing inside\nActivity requirements\nOxygen\nAssistive devices or resources\nDoing pulmonary rehab\nUsing a wheelchair\nTaking deep breaths\nBehavioral coping strategy\nRelaxing\nBreathing through the nose\nTrying to breathe as normal as possible\nMedication\nMedication\nUsing inhalers\nNot forcing myself to walk more than needed\nRest\nRest\nSitting down\nTable 4.\nMany people find shortness of breath distressing.

Eight different models were identified,\n                  including: 1) a model for organizing the phenomena related to dyspnea\n24\n; 2) a model of dyspnea\n25\n; 3) a model for operationalizing dyspnea\n26\n; 4) an ecologic model of the dyspnea experience\n27\n; 5) antecedents and reactions to dyspnea\n28\n; 6) explanatory model of functional status in COPD\n29\n; 7) a model of chronic dyspnea\n30\n; and 8) functional status model of COPD\n31\n. Each is briefly reviewed as follows.\nModel for Organizing the Phenomena Related to Dyspnea\n24\nThis model offers several ways to identify and examine dyspnea risk factors, which\n               are labeled personal, health, and situational variables. Personal variables related\n               to dyspnea include socioeconomic status (SES) and smoking history; health refers to\n               illness duration, exercise tolerance, and pulmonary function; and situational variables\n               include social support and inhalant exposure. Moderators include coping, self\u2010care\n               behaviors, and therapeutic management strategies. Although this model describes dyspnea\n               risk factors, it does not provide methods to describe and measure these phenomena.\n               Even though many of the mentioned variables might be outcomes of dyspnea, a feedback\n               loop from dyspnea to these areas would be important.\nModel of Dyspnea\n25\nThis model contains five elements reflecting the dyspnea experience, which include:\n               dyspnea sensation (mediated by sensory receptors and central nervous system), dyspnea\n               perception (affected by one's experience and adaptation), dyspnea distress, dyspnea\n               response (coping), and dyspnea reporting (descriptors of the experience). Although\n               comprehensive in describing the dyspnea experience, it does not address precipitating\n               factors, risk factors, or consequences of dyspnea on a person's quality of life. Also,\n               it does not include duration or intensity of dyspnea.\nModel for Operationalizing Dyspnea\n26\nThis model posits that dyspnea sensation and reaction occur through psychological\n               and physiological experiences that are innervated by one's culture, environment, perception,\n               and psychological state. Hypothesized consequences of these interactions are resolution\n               of the dyspnea sensation (person takes some action such as stopping the activity);\n               adaptation of the dyspnea sensation (person takes some action to mediate reaction,\n               but does not completely resolve it); and no response, in which an action has no effect\n               on the dyspnea sensation. The outcome of this model is the degree of dyspnea, which\n               is mediated by one's coping strategies versus how dyspnea might impact a person's\n               quality of life. Similar to the previous models, the consequences of dyspnea are not\n               explicitly stated.\nEcologic Model of the Dyspnea Experience\n27\nThis model characterizes dyspnea as a biopsychosocial occurrence in which environmental\n               factors (SES, social support, inhalant exposure) interact with risk and resilience\n               factors (disease, perception, coping). This interaction affects functioning and dyspnea\n               tolerance. This model contains multiple feedback loops that connect predisposing factors\n               with outcomes, but views poor physical functioning and social isolation as mediators\n               of dyspnea instead of long\u2010term outcomes, which make them difficult to target in an\n               intervention.\nAntecedents and Reactions to Dyspnea\n28\nNot necessarily viewed as a model, this schema depicts the antecedents and reactions\n               to one's dyspnea experience. The antecedents include physiological (cardiac, pulmonary,\n               and neuromuscular disease) and psychological factors (anger, anxiety, depression),\n               which are believed to make breathing more labor intensive and disrupt gas exchange.\n               Reactions are also physiological (tachypnea, tachycardia, sensory muscle use, tidal\n               volume changes) and psychological (panic, frustration, anxiety, anger, and fear).\n               One of the biggest reported limitations of this schema is its inability to describe\n               ways in which dyspnea's consequences can negatively impact a person's quality of life.\nExplanatory Model of Functional Status in COPD\n29\nThis empirically derived model tests several important physiological and psychological\n               variables (length of illness, age, dyspnea, pulmonary function, oxygen desaturation\n               during exercise, exercise capacity, anxiety, self\u2010esteem, and depressed mood) to clarify\n               their explanatory role in one's functional status in COPD. In one study, exercise\n               capacity not only demonstrated the strongest direct relationship to functional status\n               (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.34), but also served as a common pathway for pulmonary function (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.42),\n               dyspnea (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.49), and depressed mood (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.22). Dyspnea and depressed mood also\n               directly influenced functional status (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.32 and \u22120.20, respectively). In addition\n               to anxiety and self\u2010esteem's influence on depressed mood (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.70 and \u22120.50, respectively),\n               anxiety was also positively associated with the dyspnea experience (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.25). Overall,\n               the authors recommend that future interventions focus on exercise capacity, dyspnea,\n               and emotional factors such as depression and anxiety.\nModel of Chronic Dyspnea\n30\nThis model focuses on the experience of chronic dyspnea and is comprised of three\n               major components, which include physiologic antecedents, dyspnea, and consequences.\n               The antecedents include hyperinflation, increased airway resistance, and decreased\n               lung compliance, which are considered to be minor aspects of the model as they are\n               often difficult to treat once chronic dyspnea has developed. At the heart of this\n               model is the perception of persistent shortness of breath, which can vary in intensity\n               and be affected by intermittent episodes of acute dyspnea. Consequences are divided\n               into physical (reduced activity, reduced ADLs, fatigue), psychological (role loss,\n               depression) and sociocultural (isolation, occupational). Compared to acute dyspnea\n               in which psychological aspects such as fear and panic play a larger role in precipitating\n               an exacerbation, in chronic dyspnea, psychological aspects such as depression are\n               more the consequence of living with unrelenting distress.\nFunctional Status Model of COPD\n31\nThe functional status model of COPD is an empirically tested model that examines the\n               relationships between exogenous variables (disease severity, dyspnea) and endogenous\n               variables (age, exercise tolerance, fatigue, psychiatric variables, health perception,\n               and functional independence) using structural equation modeling. In their study, functional\n               performance was influenced directly by age (\u03b2\u2003=\u2003\u22120.15), exercise tolerance (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.49),\n               health perception (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.15), negative mood (\u03b2\u2003=\u2003\u22120.17), and dyspnea (\u03b2\u2003=\u2003\u22120.12).\n               Several other indirect relationships were also reported. For example, exercise tolerance\n               was influenced by age (\u03b2\u2003=\u2003\u22120.15), disease severity (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.27), health perception\n               (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.17), and negative mood (\u03b2\u2003=\u2003\u22120.34). Dyspnea influenced fatigue (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.32) and\n               negative mood (\u03b2\u2003=\u20030.22), while disease severity influenced dyspnea (\u03b2\u2003=\u2003\u22120.20). Although\n               limited by a relatively small convenience sample, these findings confirm previous\n               studies and suggest that improving dyspnea would lead to several other areas of improvement,\n               including fatigue, mood, exercise tolerance, and functional ability.\nDespite the existence of several extant models of dyspnea in COPD, none meet all of\n               the features elucidated by patients in our qualitative research. We therefore created\n               a unique dyspnea\u2010specific conceptual model, which was guided by the qualitative data\n               and informed by pre\u2010existing research and other conceptual models.\nIndividual Patient Think Aloud Interviews\nNext, to assess understandability and relevance of the emerging concepts, the patients\n               were asked to \u201cthink aloud\u201d about them in the context of their daily lives. They were\n               also asked to answer sample questions and share their thought processes on why they\n               answered as they did, including how they arrived at their answer. This is a commonly\n               practiced qualitative interviewing technique\n32\n,\n33\nthat is different from a semistructured interview in that patients are not elaborating\n               on a series of prearranged questions, per se, but rather talking and thinking out\n               load in an open\u2010ended fashion about particular concepts and how they understand them.\n               Through this process, the patients were encouraged to express their experience with\n               dyspnea, including its severity and its impact on functional activities, their emotions,\n               any limitations or avoidance of activities, and their motivation to engage in activities\n               versus a preference they might have for sedentary behavior. Responses were transcribed\n               and summarized to help deepen existing concepts in the model.\nPatient \u201cthink aloud\u201d interviews (n\u2003=\u200310) were completed by 10 people diagnosed with\n               COPD. The majority of participants were females (60%) with a mean age of 71 (range\u2003=\u200359\u201379).\n               All but two participants were Caucasian and the majority lived with others (70%).\n               Most had attended at least some college (70%), and half were retired. The average\n               number of years diagnosed with COPD was 9 (SD 10). The average GOLD standard was 4.4\n               (SD 1.4), and all but one reported a positive smoking history (mean\u2003=\u200340 pack years,\n               SD 11) with only one current smoker. Below are some sample comments in areas covered\n               by the evolving model.\nFunctional activities.\n\u201cGetting up and down, I would say there is more of a moderate shortness of breath.\n                  There is an increase in shortness of breath (more) than when I am sedentary, sitting\n                  down, but it is a matter of getting up and down in the bathtub after I am in the bathtub.\u201d\nEmotions.\n\u201cI have had nightmares and flashbacks of it [dyspnea] and being deathly afraid of\n                  not being able to breathe. Every week or so, I take a half a pill to help me calm\n                  down and not be afraid of it.\u201d\nActivity limitation/avoidance.\n\u201cI no longer will clean the house.\u2003.\u2003.\u2003.\u2003Because it was just getting to be too much.\u201d\nActivity motivation and sedentary behavior.\n\u201c[sitting] I would say probably between 80% and 90% of the day.\u201d\nDrafting a Dyspnea\u2010Specific Conceptual Model\nWe began with the model provided by Wilson and Cleary\n34\n. This model is general and fairly linear/causal, and lends itself to modification\n               based on individual disease and treatment considerations such as those that exist\n               with COPD. From this starting point, we built a dyspnea\u2010specific model that included\n               input from literature review findings, qualitative research with COPD patients, and\n               expert input. Briefly, the Wilson and Cleary\n34\nmodel of disease and PROs integrates psychological and biological components of health\n               outcomes. It includes five primary components: 1) biological and physiological variables;\n               2) symptom status; 3) functional status; 4) general health perceptions; and 5) HRQL.\nThe authors hypothesize a causal relationship beginning with the biological and physiological\n               variables and ending with HRQL after direct impact on the most proximal of concepts\n               (symptoms) which in turn can impair function and one's perceptions of health. Modification\n               (mediation) of the causal chain attributed to personal and environmental factors is\n               also key to a comprehensive and clear understanding of the linkages from biological\n               disease to perceived HRQL. Symptoms, functional status, general health perceptions,\n               and HRQL can all be influenced by personality or other characteristics of the individual.\n               They can also be influenced by the environment and other nonmedical factors. The potential\n               influence of these nonmedical factors increases as one move to the right in the model\n               from symptoms in the model, toward more general health and quality\u2010of\u2010life perceptions.\n               The simplicity and elegance of this model made it a useful starting point for our\n               dyspnea\u2010specific model, as it encompassed all of the patient comments in our qualitative\n               research.\nThe first component of the model: \u201cbiological and physiological variables,\u201d while\n               extremely relevant to COPD\u2010related dyspnea, are best measured objectively. Therefore,\n               this component of the model was not a major focus for this work. The \u201csymptom status\u201d\n               component of the model seemed to correspond well with \u201cbreathlessness\u201d and \u201cfatigue.\u201d\n               The \u201cphysical functional status\u201d component of the Wilson and Cleary model corresponded\n               with \u201cactivity limitation\u201d as generated from the open\u2010ended patient interviews. \u201cCharacteristics\n               of the individual\u201d in the model encompassed emotional responses to dyspnea and personal\n               preferences for task exertion. \u201cCharacteristics of the environment\u201d captured external\n               influences on dyspnea such as environmental toxins, use of adaptive devices, and the\n               demands of a given activity. Model elements to the far right, including \u201cgeneral health\n               perceptions,\u201d\u201cquality of life,\u201d and \u201cnonmedical factors\u201d emerged as themes, but tended\n               to be expressed as secondary to the functional impact of the disease, and to emotional\n               reactions and concerns about future health and function. General health perceptions\n               tended to emerge in the context of expressed worry or sadness regarding one's health.\n               Generic \u201cnonmedical factors\u201d such as sociocultural conditions (crime, poverty, living\n               situation) were only raised in the context of those that had impact upon COPD (i.e.,\n               environmental factors such as pollution, smoke, etc.). With the exception of the environmental\n               influences on symptoms and function, these factors are less direct compared to the\n               effects of disease and are, therefore, not a major focus of the scale development.\nDyspnea\u2010Specific Conceptual Model for COPD\nThe synthesis of patient input, expert input, and literature review led to the dyspnea\u2010specific\n               conceptual model of COPD as depicted in\nFigure\u20032\n.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nDyspnea\u2010specific conceptual model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nCaption\nDyspnea\u2010specific conceptual model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nBiological and Physiological Variables\nThis component was adapted from the Wilson and Cleary starting point to include pulmonary,\n               cardiac, and muscular function. In the presence of respiratory disorders, impairments\n               in ventilatory and gas exchange processes restrict the aerobic capacity of the exercising\n               muscle and are frequently considered to limit exercise performance. Nevertheless,\n               while these boundaries are approached during maximum exercise, they are seldom reached\n               in everyday life, and functional limitation is a common consequence of impairment\n               through the sensory system. During activities involving large muscle groups, in which\n               there is a marked ventilatory demand, there is a sense of discomfort closely related\n               to inspiratory muscle activity (e.g., exertional dyspnea). In situations where the\n               degree of exertional dyspnea exceeds that which an individual is willing to tolerate,\n               activity is volitionally terminated. Hence, exertional dyspnea may be viewed as a\n               proximal limitation to muscular performance. In COPD, excessive inspiratory effort\n               and exertional dyspnea may be caused by increased activity of the inspiratory muscles\n               caused by added mechanical loads, increased velocity of contraction at shortened muscle\n               length, mechanical disadvantages imposed on the diaphragm, and reduced efficiency\n               of gas exchange.\nDyspnea.\nThis component encompasses the patient experience of shortness of breath as influenced\n                  by biological and physiological variables. The term \u201cdyspnea\u201d reflects the focus on\n                  this cardinal symptom of COPD, including its intensity and frequency, as well as the\n                  duration of a given dyspneic episode. It considers the effects of excessive symptoms\n                  during everyday activities, in which power output can be controlled by the exercising\n                  individual. Disabled subjects have the option of either selecting the same power output\n                  and tolerating higher symptom intensity (and associated discomfort), or selecting\n                  a lower power output and maintaining the same symptom intensity, which will increase\n                  the time taken to complete a given task. Symptom intensity is not only related to\n                  power output, but also to the duration of activity, such that extending the time taken\n                  to complete the task will also have a sensory cost. Nevertheless, the sensory cost\n                  of increasing the duration of activity is dramatically less than the cost of increasing\n                  the power output. In either case, the disabled patient is handicapped by excessive\n                  symptoms during exercise, and reports this as a negative effect of exertional tasks.\n                  The magnitude of the negative effect is dependent upon a unique combination of the\n                  patient's individual characteristics and the characteristics of the environment that\n                  influence the symptom experience as well as the impact of the symptom upon functional\n                  ability.\nFunctional limitations.\nThis dimension reflects the Wilson and Cleary (1995) general concept of \u201cphysical\n                  functional status,\u201d but makes it more specific to the \u201cfunctional limitations\u201d associated\n                  with dyspnea. It represents and can be affected by the magnitude of the task and effort\n                  needed to perform certain activities. Individuals stop exercising when they are no\n                  longer willing to tolerate the discomfort associated with continuing the activity.\n                  Given that the capacity to tolerate discomfort is likely to be variable across subjects\n                  within the study population, in part as a consequence of varying levels of motivation,\n                  symptom magnitude at maximal exercise should be highly variable. We can consider the\n                  effects of excessive symptoms during everyday activities, in which the power output\n                  can be controlled by the exercising individual. Disabled subjects have the option\n                  of either selecting the same power output and tolerating higher symptom intensity\n                  (and associated discomfort), or selecting a lower power output and maintaining the\n                  same symptom intensity, which will increase the time taken to complete a given task.\n                  Symptom intensity is not only related to power output associated with function, but\n                  also to the duration of activity, such that extending the time taken to complete the\n                  task may also reduce the level of dyspnea. In this situation, the resultant increase\n                  in power output is preferable to the symptom intensity induced by performing the task\n                  more quickly. Whether the task is performed quickly at a greater intensity level or\n                  more slowly and at lower intensity, the disabled patient is handicapped by excessive\n                  symptoms during exercise.\n\u201cTask avoidance\u201d can be viewed as a component of functional limitation. It reflects\n                  a person's decision to stop engaging in certain activities when the discomfort associated\n                  with continuing the activity can no longer be tolerated. The capacity to tolerate\n                  discomfort varies across individuals and will contribute to one's rating of functional\n                  capability or limitation. If one's tolerance threshold is exceeded, he/she may report\n                  avoiding activities because of dyspnea.\n\u201cTime extension\u201d on a task can also be reported. When factors such as biological/physiological\n                  determinants, emotional status, and dispositional tendencies toward physical activity\n                  (e.g., how naturally sedentary or active a person is) are taken into account, the\n                  amount of time necessary to complete a task can indicate the challenge of a given\n                  task. A direct measure of task challenge would require some types of physiological\n                  assessment (via heart rate monitors, doubly labeled water, accelerometers, or pedometers).\n                  Asking people to report whether they are spending more or less time on a given standard\n                  task or on \u201cusual activities\u201d can serve as a reasonable operational definition as\n                  to whether there has been a meaningful increase or decrease in the duration of time\n                  needed to perform a given task. Self\u2010reported time extension can provide an estimate\n                  of how challenges of a given task influence the severity of dyspnea symptomatology\n                  and related functional limitations.\nCharacteristics of the individual.\nIndividual differences in psychological and motivational factors can have an influence\n                  on responses to questions regarding dyspnea and related functional impairment. These\n                  differences can also be influenced by an individual's limitations and perceptions\n                  about their general health and HRQL. This dimension incorporates emotional reactions\n                  to dyspnea, including anxiety, fear, panic, and depression. It also includes one's\n                  general dispositional style related to activity motivation (i.e., whether a person\n                  has a greater tendency or preference toward being active or sedentary), despite symptoms\n                  of dyspnea. These factors are hypothesized to directly influence dyspnea severity,\n                  functional limitations, health perceptions, and quality of life, and be affected by\n                  functional limitations, health perceptions, and quality of life. The arrows in the\n                  proposed conceptual depict these expected linkages.\nCharacteristics of the environment.\nThe environment of the individual can have a direct effect upon the experience and\n                  reporting of dyspnea and functional limitations. Environmental factors, including\n                  exposure to airborne allergens, pollutants, and smoke, can exacerbate problems with\n                  symptoms and function. Other environmental factors also exert direct causal effects\n                  on the concepts of interest, namely the availability and use of assistive devices\n                  (oxygen; walking aids), and external activity demands on the person (such as work\n                  or other activity requirements). These factors are hypothesized to directly influence\n                  dyspnea severity, functional limitations, health perceptions, and HRQL, and therefore\n                  should be accounted for in a comprehensive conceptual model of assessment in a clinical\n                  trial.\nConclusion\nA patient\u2010centered approach to understanding dyspnea in the context of COPD is essential\n            to evaluating disease and treatment effects. We have found that qualitative input\n            from patients and experts fits well into a new dyspnea\u2010specific conceptual model,\n            which lends itself to future applications in the design of a conceptual framework\n            and PRO instrument. This model represents the relationship between dyspnea and potential\n            critical clinical trial components, such as characteristics of the individual and\n            environment, biological and physiological variables, task challenge, and general health\n            perceptions and HRQL.\nThis study is not without limitations. One factor that was largely related to the\n            geographic location of the participating hospitals was the sex and age of the participants\n            who were recruited using a purposive, snowball sampling procedure. The \u201copen\u2010ended\u201d\n            interviews were conducted with patients who were primarily white males with an average\n            age of 81, whereas the \u201cthink aloud\u201d interviews were conducted with mostly female\n            participants, approximately 10 years younger than the patients in the \u201copen\u2010ended\u201d\n            group. A second potential limitation is the sample size of 25 participants with COPD.\n            Although a sample size such as this is not uncommon in qualitative research (compared\n            to positivistic studies requiring powered sample sizes to detect statistically significant\n            findings), future developments and modifications of this model will benefit from additional\n            perspectives from this patient population.\nHaving established a working explanatory model for the patient experience with COPD,\n            our next step is to develop a new instrument to measure the PRO components of the\n            conceptual model. Our intention is to focus more precise measurement (typically requiring\n            more items) on concepts such as dyspnea and related functional limitations. Therefore,\n            next steps include the development and testing of large pools (item banks) of questions\n            to measure dyspnea and related functional limitations, which could be analyzed to\n            select the \u201cbest in class\u201d going forward into measures tailored to COPD patient populations\n            in clinical trials. It is important to appreciate that by design, an item bank is\n            overpopulated with questions that represent the concept or \u201ctrait\u201d being measured.\n            Therefore, one rarely needs to administer all items in the bank to achieve a valid\n            score. This opens one up to the opportunity to create \u201cshort forms\u201d for clinical research\n            from a subset of items. Assuming one demonstrates unidimensionality of the concept\n            being measured and fit of the measurement model as applied to the validation data,\n            an investigator can select items freely from the bank to form a unique scale that\n            measures the concept represented by the bank. Because the items are aligned along\n            a continuum of the trait being measured, such as functional limitation, one could\n            select all items from a restricted area of the continuum (e.g., very demanding or\n            very easy tasks), or across a broad range of function, and in either case obtain a\n            common functional limitation score for the person on answering the question. Items\n            that are better targeted to the study sample will provide a more accurate score than\n            items that are not well targeted. The expectation is that this instrument would have\n            applicability for measuring meaningful change in dyspnea and related functional limitations\n            among COPD patients receiving treatment.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

The burden of cancer and other non\u2010communicable diseases will continue to rise\n            in parallel with China's rapidly ageing population; increased prevalence of health\u2010risk\n            factors including smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension and obesity; and continued\n            exposure to environmental risk factors such as air pollution (Tang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n; Goss\net\u00a0al\n.\n2014\n; World Health Organization,\n2014\n). In 2012, the age\u2010standardised incidence rate for cancer in Chinese men and women\n            combined was 174.0 per 100\u00a0000 population corresponding to an estimated 3\u00a0065\u00a0400\n            of new cases of cancer diagnosed. In that same year, over 2.2 million people died\n            from cancer with an age\u2010standardised mortality rate of 122.2 per 100\u00a0000 population.\n            The 5\u2010year prevalence for the adult population in China was estimated to be 5\u00a0045\u00a0000,\n            representing a crude rate of 456.0 adults per 100\u00a0000 diagnosed with cancer (International\n            Agency for Research in Cancer,\n2014\n). Lung, stomach, liver, colorectal and oesophageal were the five most common cancers\n            in China in 2012. Lung cancer was the most common cancer for men (25.2%) and women\n            (15.6%). As well for men, other frequent cancers were liver cancer (16.1%), stomach\n            cancer (15.6%), cancer of the oesophagus (8.8%) and colorectal cancer (8.0%). For\n            women, additional common cancers were breast cancer (15.1%), stomach cancer (9.8%),\n            colorectal cancer (8.6%) and liver cancer (8.2%) (International Agency for Research\n            in Cancer,\n2014\n).\nThe diagnosis and treatment of cancer is a major life stress for patients, their partners\n            and families, and is associated with well\u2010described physical and psychosocial difficulties\n            which can occur across the disease trajectory and may persist into survivorship (Zabora\net\u00a0al\n.\n2001\n; Pitceathly & Maguire\n2003\n; Chambers\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012a\n). Approximately one\u2010third of patients with cancer in Western contexts experience\n            ongoing clinically significant distress including anxiety and depression, adjustment\n            disorders, fears about cancer recurrence and post\u2010traumatic stress reactions, which\n            may worsen over time (Zabora\net\u00a0al\n.\n2001\n; Stein\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008\n). Increasingly, psychosocial difficulties associated with cancer diagnosis, treatment\n            and survivorship are also a focus in Chinese cancer care settings (Tang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009a\n; Grassi & Watson\n2012\n), and Chinese psycho\u2010oncology descriptive (Chambers\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n) and intervention research (Tao\net\u00a0al\n.\n2015\n). High prevalence of anxiety (49.7%) and depression (54.9%) in Chinese patients with\n            cancer has been reported in meta\u2010analysis (Yang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n) with variations in psychological morbidity by tumour site identified in cross\u2010sectional\n            studies (Hong & Tian\n2014\n; Zhao\net\u00a0al\n.\n2014\n). Psycho\u2010oncological interventions including nurse\u2010 or therapist\u2010delivered education,\n            psychotherapy, coping skills or relaxation training (or a combination of these) also\n            appear effective in reducing anxiety and depression in Chinese patients despite limitations\n            in study design, measurement and reporting (Tao\net\u00a0al\n.\n2015\n).\nAlthough this evidence is promising, establishing psycho\u2010oncology as a core component\n            of cancer care and research in China presents challenges for clinicians and researchers.\n            These challenges include cultural (e.g. non\u2010disclosure of diagnosis, beliefs about\n            illness, stigma), systemic (e.g. low value placed on psychological care, psycho\u2010oncology\n            as unscientific) and individual (e.g. lack of awareness of psychosocial issues) barriers\n            which may impact detection, intervention and treatment of psychosocial difficulties\n            experienced by patients and their families (Tang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009a\n; Yang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n). The availability of culturally appropriate, validated psycho\u2010oncology assessment\n            and screening tools is critical to meet these challenges not only to identify the\n            psychosocial needs of cancer patients and families but also to build an evidence base\n            for the prevalence and impact of psychosocial issues; evaluate the effectiveness of\n            interventions; and facilitate cross\u2010cultural comparisons in clinical trials and descriptive\n            research (Jacobsen & Donovan\n2012\n). Accordingly, the overarching aim of this review was to identify and describe at\n            a broad level the psychosocial and quality of life measures for assessment of cancer\n            patients or their caregivers in China for which validation data exist (broad review).\n            A second aim was to focus specifically on the psychometric properties of validated\n            measures which assess the psychosocial burden of cancer for patients in China (focused\n            review). It is envisaged that results of this review will serve as a resource and\n            identify gaps in knowledge to help inform researchers and clinicians using measures\n            in this setting.\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nMedline and PsycINFO (via Ovid) databases were searched (1980\u2013 Week 1, April, 2014).\n               Search terms were derived from prior systematic reviews on measurement in psycho\u2010oncology\n               (Minton & Stone\n2008\n; Pearce\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008\n) or systematic (Chambers\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012b\n; Chambers\net al\n.\n2013\n); and other reviews (Zeng\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n) on psycho\u2010oncology in Asia and included the following:\n(cancer.mp OR neoplasm$.mp OR metastasis$.mp OR malignan$.mp OR exp neoplasms/)\n(psychological.mp OR psychosocial.mp OR well\u2010being.mp OR coping.mp OR anxiety.mp OR\n                     depression.mp OR distress.mp OR survivor$.mp OR pain OR fatigue.mp OR exp quality\n                     of life/ OR exp emotional adjustment/ OR exp social adjustment)\n(scale$.mp OR validation.mp OR psychometric$.mp OR exp measurement/ OR exp psychometrics/\n                     OR exp test validity/ OR exp test construction/)\n(China.mp OR Chinese.mp OR Taiwan$.mp OR Hong Kong.mp OR Macau.mp)\n1 AND 2 AND 3 AND 4\nDuplicates were removed prior to examination of article titles and abstracts. Further\n               focussed searches with the terms \u2018Chinese\u2019 and \u2018cancer\u2019 and the names of scales commonly\n               used in psycho\u2010oncology to assess psychological distress (e.g. Distress Thermometer,\n               Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), general (e.g. SF\u201036) and cancer\u2010specific quality\n               of life (e.g. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC),\n               FACT) were conducted on Google Scholar to supplement electronic database searches\n               (Gehanno\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n). Cited references searches for relevant articles were conducted using Web of Science\n               and Google Scholar. Reference lists of articles which met final inclusion criteria\n               were also searched by hand.\nInclusion criteria\nPotentially relevant articles were identified by examining the title and abstract\n               and then retrieved for more detailed evaluation against the a priori inclusion criteria\n               by two authors and a research assistant. Any variation in inclusion/exclusion decisions\n               was discussed until consensus was reached. Studies described in peer\u2010reviewed journal\n               articles and published in English language were included if they met the following\n               pre\u2010determined criteria:\nAt least 70% were adult patients who had/have cancer and/or were partners or caregivers\n                     of cancer patients.\nSample recruitment occurred in China, Taiwan or Hong Kong.\nStudy focus was on developing or validating a measure or examining its psychometric\n                     properties and included validation data (reliability and/or validity).\nStudy included a measure to assess a psychosocial outcome (e.g. psychological distress,\n                     psychological adjustment and social adjustment) or a quality of life outcome (including\n                     fatigue, pain and sleep).\nData extraction\nOne author and a research assistant separately reviewed the articles which met final\n               inclusion criteria. A table defining the psychometric properties of interest for the\n               review was created prior to the search process (Table\n1\n) (based on Fayers & Machin\n2007\n; Minton & Stone\n2008\n; Clinton\u2010McHarg\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n). Beaton and colleagues' process recommendations outline five key stages which were\n               used to guide description of cross\u2010cultural adaptation of measures included in the\n               review: forward translation, synthesis, back translation, expert review and pre\u2010testing\n               (summarised in Table\n2\n) (Guillemin\net\u00a0al\n.\n1993\n; Beaton\net\u00a0al\n.\n2000\n).

Most articles described studies that were\n                  conducted in China (\nn\n=\u00a039) and Taiwan (\nn\n=\u00a030), followed by Hong Kong (\nn\n=\u00a024) with two cross\u2010regional studies (Hong Kong and Taiwan). Quality of life instruments\n                  were validated more often than other measures regardless of region, with comparatively\n                  less validation of measures overall in Hong Kong (26 out of 95 studies) (Table\n5\n). Instrument validation articles increased over time, with over 85% occurring since\n                  2004 (Fig.\n2\n).\nTable 5.\nInstrument validation focus in Chinese regions\nChina\nTaiwan\nHong Kong\nPsychological distress\nDT + PL\nIIRS\nMASQ\u2010SF\nDT + PL\nHADS\nIES\nMini\u2010MAC\nPSI\nCECS\nMini\u2010MAC\nPWS\nOther psychosocial\nCLCSS\nRS14\nSOC\u201013\nPTGI\nSDS\nPCSI\nCEES\nCCCS\nCSAS\nPTGI\nSRQS\nDCS\nUnmet needs\nCNQ\u2010SF\u2010HN\nSCNS\u2010SF34\nSCNS\u2010SF34\nSleep\nAIS\nPSQI\nFatigue\nBFI\nMFI\u201020\nBFI\nCFS\nFSI\nICD\u201010 CRF\nMFSI\u2010SF\nSCFS\u2010r\nPain\nBPI\nBPI\nMPI\u2010s\nPMCPI\nQuality of life\nCRA\nEORTC\u2010QLQ30\no\nBR23\no\nCR38\no\nCX24\no\nH&N35\no\nLC13\no\nSTO22\nFACT\u2010Cx\nFACT\u2010L\nMDASI\nMDASI\u2010TCM\nMQOL\nQLASTCM\u2010LU\nQLICP\u2010General Module\no\nBR\no\nCR\no\nHN\no\nLU\no\nST\nQOL\u2010LC\nQOL\u2010NPC\nCQOLC\nEORTC\u2010QLQ30\no\nBR23\no\nH&N35\no\nLC13\no\nOES18\no\nOV28\no\nPR25\nEQ\u20105D + VAS\nFACT\u2010H&N\nMQOL\nMDASI\nEORTC\u2010QLQ30\no\nCR38\no\nH&N35\nFACT\u2010General Module\no\nBMT\no\nC\no\nNP\nFLIC\nGQIQLI\nMQOL\nMSAS (+ condensed version)\nQOL\u2010RTI/H&N\nSF\u20106D\nPsychological distress\n: CECS, Courtauld Emotional Control Scale; DT, Distress Thermometer; HADS, Hospital\n                           Anxiety and Depression Scale; IES, Impact of Event Scale; IIRS, Illness Intrusiveness\n                           Ratings Scale; MASQ\u2010SF, Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire\u2010Short Form; Mini\u2010MAC,\n                           Mini\u2010Mental Adjustment to Cancer; PL, Problem List; PSI, Parenting Stress Index; PWS,\n                           Psychological Well\u2010being Scale.\nOther Psychosocial\n: CCCS, Chinese Cancer Coherence Scale; CEES, Chinese Experience and Efficacy Scale;\n                           CLCSS, Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma Scale; CSAS, Chinese Social Adjustment Scale; DCS,\n                           Decisional Conflict Scale; PCSI, Parental Coping Strategy Index; PTGI, Post\u2010Traumatic\n                           Growth Inventory; RS\u201014, Resilience Scale\u201014; SDS, Spiritual Distress Scale; SOC\u201013,\n                           Sense of Coherence Scale; SRQS, Social Relational Quality Scale.\nUnmet needs\n: CNQ\u2010SF\u2010HN, Cancer Needs Questionnaire\u2010Short Form\u2010Head and Neck; SCNS\u2010SF34, Supportive\n                           Care Needs Survey\u2010Short Form.\nSleep\n: AIS, Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS); PSQI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.\nFatigue\n: BFI, Brief Fatigue Inventory; CFS, Cancer Fatigue Scale; ICD\u201010\u2010CRF, International\n                           Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems for Cancer\u2010Related\n                           Fatigue; MFI\u201020, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory; MFSI\u2010SF, Multidimensional Fatigue\n                           Symptom Inventory\u2010Short Form; SCFS\u2010r, Schwartz Cancer Fatigue Scale\u2010revised.\nPain\n: MPI\u2010s, Multidimensional Pain Inventory\u2010Screening; PMCPI, Perceived Meanings of Cancer\n                           Pain Inventory.\nQOL/HRQOL\n: CRA, Caregiver Reaction Assessment; CQOLC, Caregiver Quality of Life Index \u2013 Cancer;\n                           EORTC\u2010QLQ30, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of\n                           Life Questionnaire; EQ\u20105D, EuroQol Questionnaire; FACT, Functional Assessment of Cancer\n                           Therapy; FLIC, Functional Living Index\u2010Cancer; FSI, Fatigue Symptom Inventory; GQIQLI,\n                           Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index; MDASI, M.

Sample sizes ranged from 64 to 1108 (Median\u00a0=\u00a0224) with patient age ranging\n                     from 42.2 to 70.6\u00a0years (M\u00a0=\u00a053.77\u00a0years). The proportion of men and women across\n                     samples was approximately evenly distributed with an average of 48.9% and 51.2% respectively.\n                     The most common cancer types represented in instrument validation studies focused\n                     on a specific cancer type (\nn\n=\u00a063) were breast (22.2%), colorectal (19.0%), head and neck (19.0%), lung (12.7%)\n                     and gynaecological (9.5%). Approximately one\u2010third (31.5%) did not focus on a specific\n                     cancer type. Figure\n3\ndisplays the number of instrument validation studies for each cancer type according\n                     to region.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nCancer type represented in instrument validation articles in Chinese regions.\nCaption\nCancer type represented in instrument validation articles in Chinese regions.\nCaregivers\nFive articles focussed on caregivers and were conducted primarily in Taiwan (\nn\n=\u00a03). Validated instruments assessed quality of life (\nn\n=\u00a02), psychological distress (\nn\n=\u00a02) or other psychosocial measures (\nn\n=\u00a01). Sample sizes ranged from 132 to 400 (median\u00a0=\u00a0183) with caregivers ranging in\n                     age from 35.1 to 42.8\u00a0years (M\u00a0=\u00a040.9\u00a0years). The average proportion of women sampled\n                     across studies (70.4%) was larger than the proportion of men (29.6%). Of studies reporting\n                     the relationship between caregivers and cancer patients, caregivers were predominantly\n                     spouses or parents. The main patient cancer type was leukaemia (cancer type was not\n                     reported in two studies).\nCultural adaptation\nMost studies (82.5%) validated established psychosocial or quality of life (including\n                  sleep, fatigue and pain) measures. Of these, 58.8% undertook the recommended steps\n                  for translation and cultural adaptation of self\u2010report measures (Table\n2\n; Guillemin\net\u00a0al\n.\n1993\n; Beaton\net\u00a0al\n.\n2000\n) or followed pre\u2010specified guidelines for quality of life measures (EORTC or FACIT);\n                  16.2% reported the translation process only; and 25% did not report a translation\n                  or cultural adaptation process. By contrast, 17.5% developed new instruments and these\n                  represented predominantly quality of life (e.g. QLICP system) and other psychosocial\n                  (e.g. social adjustment, sense of coherence) measures. Regarding country of origin,\n                  studies most commonly validated measures originating in either North America (USA\n                  and Canada;\nn\n=\u00a043, 45.2%) or Europe (\nn\n=\u00a022, 23.1%). The remaining studies validated measures originating in China (\nn\n=\u00a010, 10.5%), Hong Kong (\nn\n=\u00a05, 5.2%), Taiwan (\nn\n=\u00a03, 3.2%), UK (\nn\n=\u00a04, 4.2%), Australia (\nn\n=\u00a03, 3.2%), Japan (\nn\n=\u00a01, 1.1%), Israel (\nn\n=\u00a01, 1.1%) or multiple countries (\nn\n=\u00a03, 3.2%).\nReliability\nInternal consistency\nAs detailed in Tables\n3\nand\n4\n, 37 (40.2%) studies reported acceptable reliability based on a Cronbach's alpha coefficient\n                     above the recommended guidelines for group comparison (\n\u03b1\n>\u00a00.70; Table\n1\n), while four studies did not report internal consistency. Over half (\nn\n=\u00a051, 55.4%) described one or more subscales with internal consistency below\n\u03b1\n0.70. For instance, 11 studies validating EORTC\u2010QLQ\u2010Core or breast, gastric, head\n                     and neck, and lung cancer\u2010specific modules in China or Taiwan identified the cognitive\n                     functioning domain as having poor internal consistency (range\n\u03b1\n0.30\u20130.58) (Zhao & Kanda\n2000\n,\n2004\n; Chie\net\u00a0al\n.\n2003a\n,\nb\n; Chie\net\u00a0al\n.\n2004\n; Huang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2007a\n; Wan\net\u00a0al\n.\n2007a\n; Wan\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008a\nb\n,\nd\n; Cheng\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n; Zhang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2014\n). As well, in studies validating EORTC\u2010QLQ colorectal, ovarian or prostate cancer\u2010specific\n                     modules, chemotherapy side effects (range\n\u03b1\n0.44\u20130.63) (Law\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008\n; Chie\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010a\n; Kong\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n) and/or treatment\u2010related symptom (range\n\u03b1\n0.39\u20130.45) (Chie\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010a\n; Chie\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010c\n; Chang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n) domains were identified as problematic in five studies. Regarding developed measures,\n                     eight studies validating the System of Quality of Life Instruments for Cancer Patients\n                     general and cancer\u2010specific modules described low internal consistency for the social\n                     function domain (range\n\u03b1\n0.53\u20130.68) (Meng\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008a\n; Wan\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008a\n,\n2008c\n; Gu\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n; Wan\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n; Wan\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n; Xu\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n; Yang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012a\n).\nTest\u2013retest reliability\nForty\u2010six studies (48.4%) examined test\u2013retest reliability. Test\u2013retest time frame\n                     ranged from 1\u00a0day to 4\u00a0months (median 2\u20133\u00a0days; mode 1\u20133\u00a0days). Consistent with recommendations,\n                     the majority described good test\u2013retest reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients\n                     or Pearson's r ranging from 0.73 to 0.97 (Table\n2\n). Seventeen studies validating quality of life measures reported suboptimal test\u2013retest\n                     reliability on one or more subscales (ICC or Pearson's r range 0.19\u20130.69) (Chie\net\u00a0al\n.\n2003a\n,\nb\n; Chie\net\u00a0al\n.\n2004\n; Yeung\net\u00a0al\n.\n2006\n; Wan\net\u00a0al\n.\n2007a\n,\n2008a\n,\nd\n; Cheng\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n,\n2011\n; Ge\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n; Pien\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n; Kong\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n; Tian & Hong\n2012\n; Tzeng\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n; Wong\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n; Fong\net\u00a0al\n.\n2014\n; Hu\net\u00a0al\n.\n2014\n).\nValidity\nThe majority of studies provided some evidence of validity (92.6%), while seven studies\n                  did not describe the methods undertaken to assess validity. Seventy\u2010two studies provided\n                  evidence of convergent/criterion validity by describing the degree to which the validated\n                  measure correlated with other similar measures (including \u2018gold standard\u2019 measures),\n                  while 25 studies did not. Overall, the most common criterion measures were the Chinese\n                  versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (\nn\n=\u00a017), the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF\u201036) (\nn\n=\u00a010), and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality\n                  of Life Questionnaire Core Module (EORTC\u2010QLQ\u2010C30) (\nn\n=\u00a06). Comparatively fewer studies examined divergent validity by reporting correlations\n                  between the validated measure and other measures from which it would be expected to\n                  differ (\nn\n=\u00a026); 72.6% of studies did not provide this information. Overall, the most common\n                  measures used to assess divergent validity were the Chinese versions of the Life Orientation\n                  Test\u2010Revised (\nn\n=\u00a05); the Rosenberg self\u2010esteem scale (\nn\n=\u00a04); the HADS (\nn\n=\u00a03); and the Herth Hope Index (\nn\n=\u00a03).\nInformation regarding sensitivity and specificity of validated measures was reported\n                  in nine studies, with 27 studies describing the responsiveness of the measure for\n                  detecting change in scores over time. Known\u2010groups comparisons were conducted in 48\n                  instrument validation studies (i.e. known groups/clinical validity). Overall, studies\n                  commonly discriminated groups on the basis of their performance or functional status\n                  (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group\u2010Performance Status Rating, Karnofsky Performance\n                  Status Index scores) (\nn\n=\u00a018); type of treatment (\nn\n=\u00a012); and stage of treatment (\nn\n=\u00a012).\nCharacteristics of studies included in the focused review on psychosocial measures\nSearch results for psychosocial measures\nConsistent with the second aim of this review, the review focus was narrowed to consider\n                  instrument validation for assessment of the psychosocial burden associated with cancer\n                  for patients. For the purposes of this review, the term psychosocial encompassed psychological,\n                  social or unmet needs (Pirl\n2010\n). Thus, as a final step, articles describing quality of life measures or measures\n                  for caregivers were excluded, leaving 25 articles validating psychosocial measures\n                  for patients in China. Of these, 11 studies validated measures of psychological distress\n                  including the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale, Distress Thermometer, Hospital Anxiety\n                  and Depression Scale, Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale, Impact of Event Scale,\n                  Mini\u2010Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale, and the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire\u2010Short\n                  Form; 11 validated other psychosocial measures such as the Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma\n                  Scale, Decisional Conflict Scale, Post\u2010Traumatic Growth Inventory, Resilience Scale\u201014,\n                  Sense of Coherence Scale and the Social Relational Quality Scale; and three validated\n                  measures of unmet needs including the Supportive Care Needs Survey\u2010Short Form.

Sample sizes ranged from\n                  85 to 1029 (Median\u00a0=\u00a0279) with patients aged from 42.8 to 65.7\u00a0years (M\u00a0=\u00a052.48\u00a0years).\n                  The proportion of men (48.1%) and women (51.9%) across samples was relatively evenly\n                  distributed. Breast and colorectal cancer were the most common cancer types represented\n                  in 36% and 12% of studies respectively. Sixteen per cent did not focus on a specific\n                  cancer type.\nCultural adaptation of psychosocial measures\nApproximately, half of the 25 psychosocial measures were based on established instruments\n                  originating predominantly in North America (\nn\n=\u00a013, 52%). Twelve studies validating psychosocial measures followed recommended guidelines\n                  for translation and cultural adaptation; three reported the translation process only;\n                  six did not report a translation or cultural adaptation process; and four were newly\n                  developed measures. Studies were also examined for author reports on difficulties\n                  experienced in achieving conceptual or semantic equivalence of translated measures.\n                  Of the studies reporting a translation process, five did not make reference to any\n                  difficulties in the translation of measures (Ho\net\u00a0al\n.\n2004a\nb\n; Chen\net\u00a0al\n.\n2005\n; Wang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n,\n2013a\n; Ho\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n); two explicitly reported that their participants experienced no difficulty responding\n                  to the translated version (Ho\net\u00a0al\n.\n2004a\n; Chen\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n); five indicated there may have been difficulty in achieving equivalence between\n                  translated and back\u2010translated versions but did not identify particular items (Ho\net\u00a0al\n.\n2003\n; Hou\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n; Au\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n; Lam\net\u00a0al\n.\n2015\n; Tian & Hong\n2013\n); and three identified modifications made to specific items to ensure semantic or\n                  conceptual equivalence (Li\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n; Wang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013c\n; Yang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2014\n). For example, Wang and colleagues identified difficulty with translation of the\n                  word \u2018distress\u2019 and reported \u2018xinlitongku\u2019 as the specific Chinese term chosen to\n                  represent distress (Wang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013a\nc\n).\nReliability for psychosocial measures\nTwelve (54.5%) studies demonstrated acceptable internal consistency with Cronbach's\n                  alpha coefficients exceeding 0.70; nine (40.1%) reported poor internal consistency\n                  for one or more subscales; and one study did not report a Cronbach's alpha coefficient\n                  (Table\n6\n). In both studies validating the Mini\u2010Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale, cognitive\n                  avoidance demonstrated lower than recommended reliability (\n\u03b1\n0.65, Ho\net\u00a0al\n.\n2003\n;\n\u03b1\n0.56, Wang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013a\n). As well, the Post\u2010Traumatic Growth Inventory had low internal consistency for subscales,\n                  although the total scale reliability was sufficient (Ho\net\u00a0al\n.\n2004a\nb\n; Ho\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n). Regarding stability of the psychosocial measures, six studies (24%) examined test\u2013retest\n                  reliability with a test\u2013retest time frame ranging from 3\u00a0days to 4\u00a0months (median\n                  7\u201321\u00a0days). All studies described good test\u2013retest reliability (ICC or\nr\n\u2265\u00a00.80).\nValidity for psychosocial measures\nAll except two psychosocial studies provided some evidence of validity (Table\n6\n). Specifically, 23 studies validated measures for psychological distress, other psychosocial\n                  aspects, or unmet needs and described convergent/criterion validity. The HADS was\n                  the most common criterion measure for psychosocial instruments, used in 15 of 23 studies.\n                  As well, the HADS and LOT\u2010R were more frequently used as comparison measures in five\n                  of nine studies describing divergent validity data.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of psychosocial instruments was described in seven\n                  studies validating Chinese versions of the Distress Thermometer (\nn\n=\u00a05), HADS (\nn\n=\u00a01) or Resilience Scale\u201014 (\nn\n=\u00a01). Regarding the Distress Thermometer, sensitivity ranged from 0.42 to 0.98 and\n                  specificity from 0.70 to 0.85. A cut\u2010off score of 4 or 5 was recommended as optimal\n                  for screening for distress in Chinese patients with cancer. Two studies reported positive\n                  predictive values >0.60 and negative predictive values >0.85. One study described\n                  responsiveness of the Distress Thermometer from the beginning to end of treatment.\n                  For the HADS, one study reported sensitivity of 0.84 and specificity of 0.68 with\n                  an optimal cut\u2010off score of 15. Sensitivity (0.74) and specificity (0.71) of the Chinese\n                  Resilience Scale\u201014 was also reported with a cut\u2010off score of 64 identified as optimal.\n                  Known\u2010groups validity was described in eight studies validating measures for other\n                  psychosocial aspects (\nn\n=\u00a05) or unmet needs (\nn\n=\u00a03) with groups most commonly differentiated on the basis of age or type of treatment.\nDiscussion\nThe number of published, peer\u2010reviewed psycho\u2010oncology instrument validation studies\n            conducted in Chinese cancer patient and caregiver populations focused on quality of\n            life increased steadily over time from 1996 to 2014. By comparison, validation of\n            psychosocial instruments occurred predominantly from 2009, with a focus on measures\n            of psychological distress increasing from 2011. These findings may reflect broader\n            trends in cancer research and practice. Specifically, the greater focus on validation\n            of quality of life measures may be attributed to the proliferation of quality of life\n            research more broadly and the availability of structured guidelines and systems to\n            support translation of quality of life measures. In this regard, the EORTC Quality\n            of Life Group Translation Procedure (Dewolf\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n) and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Translation Services (FACITtrans)\n            (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Organisation,\n2010\n) based in North America are key examples. In contrast, no parallel structure or support\n            exists for translation of psychosocial measures and it remains to be seen whether\n            the recent focus in research and clinical practice on patient reported outcomes and\n            associated frameworks (e.g. PROMS; Black & Jenkinson\n2009\n; Roberts\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n) will remedy this gap.\nIn 2010, the International Psycho\u2010Oncology Society (IPOS) developed an International\n            Standard of Quality Cancer Care for integration of the psychosocial domain into routine\n            cancer care and recognition of distress as the 6th vital sign following temperature,\n            blood pressure, pulse, respiration and pain (Holland\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n). Subsequent endorsement of this standard by the Union for International Cancer Control\n            and the mandate for cancer care organisations worldwide to incorporate distress screening\n            as a routine part of cancer care has drawn focus internationally on not only the importance\n            of psychosocial care of cancer patients but also the need for validated gold standard\n            measures to assess distress (Holland\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n; Jacobsen & Donovan\n2012\n). The increased validation of psychological distress measures in Chinese psycho\u2010oncology\n            patient populations since 2011 may be explained at least in part by these developments.\nInstrument validation studies for specific cancer types identified in this review\n            focused more often on breast cancer, followed by colorectal and head and neck cancer.\n            While this trend concurs with psycho\u2010oncology reviews in both Western (Sanson\u2010Fisher\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n) and Chinese (Chambers\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n) contexts where breast cancer has consistently attracted more research attention,\n            it suggests a gap in validation or translation of measures that match current and\n            estimated future cancer incidence and mortality rates; a trend that is evident worldwide\n            and not unique to China. Based on rates of cancer incidence and mortality in China\n            (International Agency for Research in Cancer,\n2014\n), more research attention needs to be directed towards the development and validation\n            of lung, liver and stomach cancer instruments for patients. As well, prostate cancer\n            has been identified as an emerging priority in Asia and China specifically with evidence\n            for increased prostate cancer incidence and mortality (Center\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n; Baade\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n). However, only two studies on prostate cancer\u2010specific instruments were identified\n            in this review. A focus on men with prostate cancer and validation of relevant measures\n            to assess their psychosocial well\u2010being and quality of life is needed (see also Chambers\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n).\nMost studies included in the current review provided some evidence of reliability\n            and/or validity; however, this was not universally consistent. Reported internal consistency\n            for subscales in over half of the studies reviewed was below the recommended guidelines\n            of\n\u03b1\n\u2265\u00a00.70 (Bland & Altman\n1997\n). In this regard, a consistently low Cronbach's alpha for the cognitive function\n            subscale derived from the EORTC Quality of Life measure (EORTC\u2010QLQ\u2010C30) was identified\n            as a recurrent trend in this review. Although a previous review of health\u2010related\n            quality of life measures in other settings noted that the two\u2010item cognitive functioning\n            scale from the EORTC\u2010QLQ\u2010C30 most often demonstrated Cronbach's alpha below 0.70 (Luckett\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n), it is unclear whether the poor internal consistency of this measure in Chinese\n            cancer patient populations is similarly due to the low number of items; cultural inappropriateness\n            of the scale; or other factors including research group or research settings. Less\n            than half of all studies reviewed examined test\u2013retest reliability and when psychosocial\n            measures were considered specifically, less than 25% of these studies provided this\n            information. Quality of life and psychosocial outcome measures are routinely used\n            in psycho\u2010oncology clinical trials, intervention and descriptive research, and the\n            lack of evidence supporting temporal stability of the measures reviewed is problematic.\nIn demonstrating validity, the studies reviewed more often provided evidence for convergent/criterion\n            validity; over 70% did not provide information about divergent validity. The HADS\n            was commonly used as the \u2018gold standard\u2019 measure for validation of quality of life\n            and psychosocial measures. However, of all the studies included in this review only\n            one validated the HADS with cancer patients in China and this study did not provide\n            information regarding reliability or the cultural adaptation process (Wang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n). Measures may perform differently in different settings and it is therefore critical\n            for these measures to be tested and validated for use in the intended target population\n            (Jacobsen & Donovan\n2012\n), in this case cancer patients in China. Moreover, as the most widely used self\u2010report\n            measure of psychological or emotional distress in cancer care settings internationally,\n            the HADS has well\u2010described inconsistencies in its latent structure, with variations\n            in this structure dependent upon the statistical methods utilised (Cosco\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n). Thus, additional research appears warranted to validate the HADS in Chinese cancer\n            care settings and determine suitability of the measure before further application.\n            Consistent with prior reviews on quality of life measures (Pearce\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008\n; Clinton\u2010McHarg\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n), few studies in the current review provided information regarding sensitivity, specificity\n            or responsiveness for the measures validated.\nInstrument validation studies in this review were based predominantly on measures\n            originating in North America or Europe with few reporting development of novel measures\n            for use in China. Approximately, half of the studies reviewed (excluding those following\n            EORTC or FACIT guidelines) undertook all recommended steps for translation and cultural\n            adaptation of measures (Guillemin\net\u00a0al\n.\n1993\n; Beaton\net\u00a0al\n.\n2000\n). Regarding psychosocial measures specifically, only three studies identified difficulties\n            experienced in translating items and described subsequent modifications to achieve\n            conceptual or semantic equivalence. It is unclear whether it is truly the case that\n            few difficulties were experienced or whether the authors of instrument validation\n            studies were not aware of or did not report these difficulties. This finding concurs\n            with a prior study in which few concerns were expressed by researchers using a translated\n            version of the HADS despite issues with the measure identified in the broader literature\n            (e.g. factor structure; use of colloquialisms) (Maters\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n). Failure to observe or underreporting of cultural adaptation of measures can draw\n            into question the validity of a scale (is it measuring what it is designed to measure?)\n            and impact scale means, factor structure and cut\u2010off values as well as diminishing\n            the possibility for comparison with studies of similar focus or inclusion in reviews\n            or meta\u2010analysis (Coyne & van Sonderen\n2012\n; Maters\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n). Given these implications, there is an urgent need for greater transparency and\n            accuracy of reporting regarding the translation and cultural adaptation of measures\n            in psycho\u2010oncology instrument validation studies and research in China and elsewhere.\nLimitations\nThis review is limited in three main ways. First, the focus on English language, full\u2010text\n            journal articles, does not capture existing studies reported only in Chinese language.\n            In this regard, 18 of the 67 excluded studies with English language only abstracts\n            potentially met review criteria. These studies examined psychometric properties of\n            three psychological distress, three other psychosocial, one fatigue and 11 quality\n            of life measures (Table\n7\n), almost half (44.4%) of which appear to be developed measures. Second, there were\n            clear gaps in validation studies in specific Chinese regions, where scales measuring\n            sleep (China, Hong Kong), unmet needs (China), fatigue (Hong Kong) and pain (Hong\n            Kong) were either not captured by this review or have not been validated with cancer\n            patients (Table\n5\n). More broadly, missing or non\u2010reported psychometric information combined with most\n            measures having been validated in only one study resulted in the absence of a collective\n            body of validation work for quality of life and psychosocial measures, precluded accurate\n            and evidence\u2010based conclusions about measures which are most optimal, should not be\n            recommended for use, or require further development. Third, it was beyond the scope\n            of this review to examine all types of validity. Instead our focus was limited to\n            convergent, divergent and known\u2010groups (clinical) validity consistent with the types\n            of validity covered in prior psychometric reviews (Minton & Stone\n2008\n; Ojo\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n).\nTable 7.\nMeasure characteristics, cultural adaptation process, psychometric properties and\n               associated sample characteristics for English language only abstracts\nMeasure (abbreviation), country of origin\nItems\nSource\nSample characteristics\nCultural adaptation process\nReliability\nValidity\nAuthor Year Journal\nLocation\nN\nAge in years M (SD)\nSex (%)\nCancer type (%)\n\u03b1\nTest\u2013retest (ICC,\nr\n)\nPsychological distress\nAnxiety Sensitivity Index\u20103 (ASI\u20103); NR\nNR\nWang\net\u00a0al\n.

Specifically, findings of this review suggest three key areas\n            for continued development in China and elsewhere: (1) validation of measures that\n            reflect priority cancer types indicated by Chinese cancer incidence and mortality\n            rates; (2) appropriate support and structure for translation of psychosocial measures,\n            perhaps under the guidance or sponsorship of leading international bodies such as\n            IPOS (International Psycho\u2010Oncology Society,\n2013\n); and (3) greater frequency, accuracy and transparency in reporting of information\n            about reliability, validity, translation and cultural adaptation processes in quality\n            of life and psychosocial instrument validation studies. Such development aligns with\n            the trend towards increased international focus on patient\u2010reported outcome measures\n            (Acquadro\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008\n; Li\net\u00a0al\n.\n2014\n); data pooling and creation of data repositories; and the need for harmonisation\n            to support these methods (Wild\net\u00a0al\n.\n2005\n; Acquadro\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008\n; Riley\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n).\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Andrew Munnings for research assistance.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

Similar assumptions are made\n            about older people's use of ICT\u2010based care such as telecare and telehealth. To examine the evidence around these\n            claims, we conducted a scoping review of the academic and grey literature, coving\n            the period between January 2007 and August 2014. A framework analysis approach, based\n            on six domains of QOL derived from the ASCOT and WHOQOL models, was adopted to deductively code and analyse relevant literature. The review\n            revealed mixed results. Older people's use of ICT in both mainstream and care contexts has been shown to have both positive and negative\n            impacts on several aspects of QOL. Studies which have rigorously assessed the impact of older people's use of ICT on their QOL mostly demonstrate little effect. A number of qualitative studies have reported on\n            the positive effects for older people who use ICT such as email or Skype to keep in touch with family and friends. Overall, the review\n            unearthed several inconsistencies around the effects of older people's ICT use on their QOL, suggesting that implicit agreement is needed on the best research methods and instrumentation\n            to adequately describe older people's experiences in today's digital age. Moreover,\n            the available evidence does not consider the large number of older people who do\nnot\nuse ICT and how non\u2010use affects QOL.\nWhat is known about this topic\nSome research indicates that older people's use of email and Skype positively affects\n                           their quality of life (QOL) by enabling them to keep in touch with friends and relatives.\nResearch suggests mobile phone ownership can have a positive effect on older people's\n                           sense of safety and security.\nWhat this paper adds\nThe empirical evidence demonstrates that the effects of older people's use of ICT,\n                           for both mainstream and remote care purposes, on different domains of QOL can be both\n                           positive and negative, challenging common assumptions that ICT is unquestionably beneficial.\nHighlights the strengths and limitations of different research methods used for generating\n                           evidence on the effects of technology use on QOL.\nIntroduction\nThe impact of new information and communication technology (ICT), such as mobile telephones,\n            computers and the Internet, on the lives of older people is unclear, with both positive\n            and negative views expressed. We review evidence on the impact of ICT on quality of\n            life (QOL) of older people, with respect to both their day\u2010to\u2010day lives in general\n            and their health and social care needs in particular.\nMethods\nWe undertook a scoping review, adhering to guidelines outlined in Arksey and O'Malley\n            (\n2005\n). Initial searches were conducted on 8 August 2012 in databases focused on relevant\n            disciplines including ICT and communications (Library, Information Science and Technology\n            Abstracts, Communications and Mass Media Complete), social sciences (International\n            Bibliography of Social Sciences, PAIS International, SocIndex Full text, Web of Science\n            Core Collections), psychology (PsycINFO), and health and social care (CINAHL Full\n            text, PubMed). The database review was restricted to peer\u2010reviewed journal articles\n            published between January 2007 and August 2012. Searches were repeated on 15 August\n            2014 to identify articles (published between January 2012 and August 2014). Boolean\n            terms for the search are described in Table\n1\n.\nTable 1.\nSearch strategy\nBoolean terms\nSearch 1\nSU(\u201colder people\u201d OR \u201celderly\u201d)\nSearch 2\nTX(\u201cdigital inclusion\u201d OR \u201ce\u2010inclusion\u201d OR \u201cdigital divide\u201d)\nSearch 3\nTX(\u201cinternet\u201d OR \u201c?phone\u201d OR \u201ccomputer\u201d OR \u201cdigital technology\u201d)\nSearch 4\nTX(\u201ctelecare\u201d OR \u201ctelehealth\u201d OR \u201ctelemedicine\u201d OR \u201csmart?home\u201d)\nSearch 5\n(Search 2 OR Search 3 OR Search 4)\nSearch 6\nSearch 1 AND Search 5\nSearches yielded 1129 unique references. After screening titles, abstracts and full\n            texts, in turn, for relevance in terms of older people's access to ICT and effects\n            on QOL, the final selection included 91 key articles. We included articles discussing\n            a broad range of ICT used by adults explicitly described as \u2018older\u2019, \u2018elderly\u2019 or\n            \u2018senior citizens\u2019. The main reasons for exclusion included no reference to ICT usage,\n            no analyses of older adults and studies in tertiary care settings. Studies were also\n            excluded if the primary outcomes focused\nsolely\non technical feasibility of the ICT system, changes in vital signs, changes in use\n            of health and social care and use of ICT by care staff.\nWe supplemented the database search with hand\u2010searches for policy documents and reports\n            from organisations such as Age UK, International Longevity Centre \u2013 UK, Department\n            of Health, Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) and Ofcom. Other literature\n            sources were identified through bibliographies of journal articles and reports. Supporting\n            evidence was sought by using the Google search engine, with search terms such as \u201cquality\n            of life\u201d AND \u201colder people\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d.\nDefinitions\nWhat is mainstream ICT?\nWe define mainstream ICT to be contemporary generic technology devices, services,\n               applications and Internet platforms used by large proportions of the population in\n               Britain as indicated by OfCom (\n2014\n). It includes Internet networks, mobile phones, smart phones, computers and tablet\n               computers.\nWhat is remote care?\nBarlow and Knapp (\n2014\n) define remote care as \u2018assisted living\u2019 technologies which use ICT devices and telecommunications\n               network to deliver health and social care remotely \u2013 often in someone's home. It includes\n               overlapping concepts such as \u2018telecare\u2019, \u2018telehealth\u2019, \u2018telemedicine\u2019 and \u2018smart homes\u2019\n               (Barlow\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n), which represent the range of remote alert, monitoring and consultation services\n               currently deployed within health and social care systems. Emerging concepts such as\n               \u2018mCare\u2019, \u2018mHealth\u2019 and \u2018wellness services\u2019 also embody the notion of remote care.\n               mCare (or \u2018mHealth\u2019) uses mobile devices as the gateway to services (Telecare Services\n               Association,\n2013a\n). Wellness services refer to ICT applications that promote healthy living and include\n               technologies which stimulate cognitive and physical fitness, as well as \u2018social robotics\u2019\n               designed to facilitate social exchange (Carretero\n2015\n).\nTelecare is defined as 24\u2010hour remote support and assistance provided through alarm\n               and monitoring equipment (e.g. pendent alarm, enuresis pad), permitting detection\n               of (and response to) personal emergencies (e.g. falling) and adverse home events (e.g.\n               bathroom flood) in real\u2010time (Telecare Services Association,\n2013b\n). Smart homes refer to the range of \u2018domotics\u2019 devices consisting of sensors, actuators\n               and other wireless technologies, also referred to as advanced forms of monitoring\n               and alert telecare services (Kubitschke & Cullen\n2010\n). Telehealth is the remote transmission of vital sign data (e.g. blood pressure)\n               between patients and healthcare professionals. Data are transmitted using peripheral\n               ICT devices (e.g. pulse oximeter) for clinical review via telephone line or broadband\n               Internet. Telehealth services facilitate detection of abnormal patterns in vital signs\n               and instigate interventions to prevent deterioration of health (Telecare Services\n               Association,\n2013c\n), without patients having to present themselves at face\u2010to\u2010face appointments (Department\n               of Health,\n2011\n). Telemedicine refers to use of ICT (e.g. video\u2010conferencing) between healthcare\n               professionals and patients, for remote consultation, diagnosis and treatment services\n               (European Commission,\n2009\n).\nData analysis\nTo analyse outcomes of using mainstream ICT and ICT\u2010based care, we adapted the Adult\n               Social Care Outcomes Toolkit (ASCOT) (Netten\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n) and WHOQOL (The WHOQOL Group\n1998\n) models. Both frameworks are internationally recognised and incorporate similar dimensions\n               and facets, but diverge slightly in focus.\nASCOT measures social care\u2010related QOL. Based on Sen's (\n1985\n) study of social capital and capabilities, it measures individuals\u2019 choice and control\n               with respect to social care, rather than functioning. ASCOT emphasises individuals\u2019\ncapabilities\n(Table\n2\n).\nTable 2.\nASCOT domains\nDomain\nDefinition\nControl over one's life\nAbility to choose what to do and when to do it. Having control over daily activities\nPersonal cleanliness and comfort\nBeing clean, dressed and groomed to the level that the person feel comfortable and\n                              presentable\nFood and drink\nHas enough food and drink, which is nutritious, varied and culturally acceptable\nPersonal safety\nFeeling safe and secure, free from abuse, harm or falling\nSocial participation and involvement\nContent with social interactions with family, friends, and feeling part of the community\nOccupation\nSufficiently occupied with a range of meaningful activities\nAccommodation cleanliness and comfort\nCleanliness and comfort of home environment\nDignity\nPsychological impact of using social care services according to users\u2019 personal sense\n                              of significance\nSource: ASCOT: Main guidance, v2.1 (Netten\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n).\nWHOQOL is based on a multidimensional perspective of QOL, applicable to varying circumstances\n               and cultures throughout the world. It assesses how individuals\nfunction\nacross a range of living environments (Table\n3\n).\nTable 3.\nWHOQOL domains\nDomain\nFacets\nPhysical\nPain and discomfort\nEnergy and fatigue\nSleep and rest\nPsychological\nPositive and negative feelings\nThinking, learning, memory and concentration\nSelf\u2010esteem\nBodily image and appearance\nLevel of independence\nMobility\nActivities of daily living\nDependence on medication or treatments\nWork capacity\nSocial relationships\nPersonal relationships\nSocial support\nSexual activity\nEnvironment\nFreedom, physical safety and security\nHome environment\nFinancial resources\nHealth and social care: accessibility and quality\nOpportunities for acquiring new information and skills\nRecreation and leisure activities\nPhysical environment (e.g. pollution, noise)\nTransport\nSpirituality\nReligion, personal beliefs\nOverall QOL and general health perceptions\nSource: WHOQOL revised version, 2012.\nThe capability approach in ASCOT can be used to assess effects of ICT use on individuals\u2019\n               ability to live the life they choose. Some ASCOT dimensions are less fully defined\n               for our needs here; e.g. dignity focuses primarily on self\u2010esteem, whereas other emotions\n               (e.g. anxiety, fear, contentment and optimism) are also relevant. There is also no\n               domain measuring QOL aspects which reflect\nphysical\ncapabilities. Therefore, we draw on the WHOQOL framework for domains and facets complementary\n               to ASCOT.\nOur combined QOL framework has six dimensions (Table\n4\n), four from ASCOT (control over one's life, personal safety, social participation\n               and involvement, and occupation), slightly amended to incorporate complementary facets\n               of WHOQOL, and two (psychological well\u2010being and physical health) primarily based\n               on WHOQOL. Psychological well\u2010being is an expanded version of the ASCOT dignity dimension,\n               including a broader scope of feelings suggested by WHOQOL. The physical health dimension\n               and related facets combine the WHOQOL model and items developed specifically for this\n               research.\nTable 4.\nDescription of the combined ASCOT and WHOQOL model\nDomains of combined QOL model\nFacets of combined QOL model\nWHOQOL facets not considered in combined model\nControl over one's life\nIndependence\nPersonal cleanliness and comfort\nFood and drink\nAccommodation cleanliness and comfort/home environment\nActivities of daily living\nDependence on medicine and treatment\nFinancial resources\nPersonal safety and security\nFeeling safe, secure, free from abuse and harm\nFreedom from crime\nPrivacy\na\nAvailability of health and social care\nTransport\nPhysical environment\nSocial involvement and participation\nPersonal relationships with family, friends\nFeeling part of the community\nSexual activity\nOccupation\nPaid employment/work capacity\nb\nCaring for others\nVolunteer work\nRecreation and leisure\nInformation\u2010seeking/opportunities for learning new skills\nc\nPsychological well\u2010being\nDignity\nd\nSense of personal significance\nPositive and negative feelings\nSelf\u2010esteem\nObtrusiveness/bodily image and appearance\ne\nPhysical capability\nf\nIndicators of health status\nPhysical activity\nMemory and cognition\ng\nHealth\u2010related behaviour\nSpirituality\nh\nHealth\u2010related awareness and knowledge\na\nPrivacy is an additional facet to the personal safety and security domain.\nb\nThe \u2018work capacity\u2019 facet of the independence domain of WHOQOL is discussed in the\n                        context of ability to carry out paid employment in the occupational domain of the\n                        combined QOL model.\nc\nThe opportunities for learning new skills is a facet of the environmental domain of\n                        WHOQOL is introduced as the \u2018information\u2010seeking\u2019 facet of the occupational domain\n                        in the combined model.\nd\nThe dignity domain of ASCOT is renamed the psychological well\u2010being model after the\n                        WHOQOL psychological domain; dignity is a facet of the psychological domain in the\n                        combined model.\ne\nObtrusiveness is related to the bodily image and appearance facet of the psychological\n                        domain of the WHOQOL model, and is introduced to the psychological well\u2010being domain\n                        in the combined model.\nf\nPhysical is not an original ASCOT domain and is taken from the \u2018physical\u2019 domain from\n                        WHOQOL.\ng\nMemory and cognition are normally included in the psychological well\u2010being domain\n                        of WHOQOL, but are considered to be part of the physical capability domain in the\n                        combined model.\nh\nThe spirituality and personal beliefs facet of the WHOQOL model is not included in\n                        the combined QOL model.\nWe used a framework analysis approach from Gale\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2013\n) to examine the literature, coding deductively according to our six dimensions (Table\n4\n).\nFindings\nTable\n5\nsummarises studies which provided evidence on effects of ICT use in both mainstream\n            and remote care contexts. A wide range of both qualitative and quantitative research\n            methods and instruments are employed across many studies with varying effects. We\n            now describe this evidence for each of the six QOL domains in turn.\nTable 5.\nSummary of evidence on the effects of ICT use for mainstream and remote care purposes\n               on six domains of QOL\nAuthor (year)\nN\nparticipants\n\u2018Older person\u2019 definition (years)\nCountries\nFacet\nTechnology\nMethodology\nDirection of effect on QOL domain\nQOL definitions/instruments\nControl over daily live \u2013 Mainstream\nHarrod (\n2011\n)\n8\n58\u201372\nUnited States\nConducting IADL\nInternet\nSemi\u2010structured questionnaire\nNegative (Qualitative)\nSymbolic capital (Bourdieu 1987)\nKoopman\u2010Boyden and Reid (\n2009\n)\n1680\n65\u201384\nNew Zealand\nPhysical environment inside and outside of the house\nInternet\nEmail\nStructured telephone interview\nNo significant effect\nStudy\u2010specific\nLeppel and McCloskey (\n2011\n)\n188; 50+:97\n18\u201325; 50+\nUnited States\nShopping\nInternet\nStructured postal questionnaire\nNo significant effect\nStudy\u2010specific\nMason\net\u00a0al\n.

Available at:\nhttp://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/\n(accessed on 7 July 2015).\na\nThe definition of these facets (loneliness, obtrusiveness, anxiety) is integrally\n                     negative. The reported effects of ICT use on these facets are opposite to the overall\n                     effect on the overarching QOL domain, e.g. positive obtrusiveness represents a negative\n                     effect on psychological well\u2010being; negative loneliness is a positive effect on social\n                     involvement and participation.\nControl over one's life\nControl over one's life includes dimensions from ASCOT including \u2018personal cleanliness\n               and comfort\u2019, \u2018food and drink\u2019 and \u2018accommodation cleanliness and comfort\u2019 as well\n               as elements from WHOQOL including \u2018independence\u2019, mobility and activities of daily\n               living (ADLs). The domain therefore includes indicators of ability to manage ADLs\n               (e.g. personal hygiene, dressing, feeding) and instrumental activities of daily living\n               (IADLs) (e.g. shopping, cleaning, preparing meals).\nMainstream ICT\nEvidence suggests that using computers and the Internet gives older people a greater\n                  sense of independence and control over their daily lives (Selwyn\n2004\n, Morris\net\u00a0al\n.\n2007\n). Mason\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2012\n) discovered a significant association between Internet use and perception of control.\n                  Slegers\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n) found that older adults who used their computers often showed a significant increase\n                  in sense of control over life over 12 months, whereas those who used a computer only\n                  occasionally had a significant\ndecrease\n. Martinez\u2010Pecino\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2012\n) reported that older people who own a mobile phone felt a sense of freedom and independence.\nWith respect to specific IADLs, Selwyn (\n2004\n) described anecdotal evidence of perceptions of how ICT helped individuals to keep\n                  their house in order and do shopping. Koopman\u2010Boyden and Reid (\n2009\n) on the other hand, found no significant relationship between Internet and email\n                  use and satisfaction with physical environment, and Harrod's (\n2011\n) qualitative evidence suggested that older people felt pressured to demonstrate their\n                  ability to use ICT for shopping and banking to deflect the societal stigma of being\n                  dependent.\nLeppel and McCloskey (\n2011\n) found no significant differences in attitudes concerning usefulness of online shopping\n                  between younger and older groups. They also found that adults aged 50\u201369 made more\n                  online purchases than those aged 18\u201325 and those aged over 69. Those in the older\n                  age group rarely made online purchases, but did search the Internet for information\n                  about goods and services.\nAn emerging theme around independence and control was use of mainstream ICT to prepare\n                  for the future. Selwyn (\n2004\n) discovered that older people sometimes adopted mainstream ICT applications (e.g.\n                  email, Internet shopping and banking) pre\u2010emptively. In other words, some younger\u2013older\n                  people adopted ICT in preparation for a future when they might have less control over\n                  their ADLs and IADLS as a result of being less mobile or having more financial constraints.\nRemote care\nUnderpinning \u2018ageing in place\u2019 policies is the promotion of independence, enabling\n                  older people to continue to live in their own homes supported by ICT\u2010based care (Sixsmith\n                  & Sixsmith\n2008\n, Matthews\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n).\nFrost\net\u00a0al\n.'s (\n2010\n) review of ICT\u2010based care reported qualitative evidence showing positive effects\n                  of ICT\u2010based care on independence, in terms of improved mobility and ability to carry\n                  out ADLs. Brandt\net\u00a0al\n.'s (\n2011\n) review of telecare and smart home services found few studies which assessed effects\n                  of ICT\u2010based care on IADLs. Overall, ICT\u2010based care interventions tended to have positive\n                  effects on independence and ability to perform IADLs. Age UK (\n2010\n), Milligan\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) and Matthews\net al\n. (\n2010\n) also noted that ICT\u2010based care empowered (older) people with disabilities by compensating\n                  for some physical impairments, which otherwise prevented them from managing their\n                  ADLs.\nQuantitative evidence concerning the effects of use of ICT\u2010based care on ability to\n                  carry out ADLs and IADLs was limited. Brownsell\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n) noted that using telecare services had no significant effects on ability to carry\n                  out ADLs. Nijland\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2009\n) found no difference between older and younger people using an email consultation\n                  service to contact their GP in terms of felt control. Damant\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2013\n) noted that more people participating in the MonAMI study perceived telecare services\n                  to be helpful rather than unhelpful in performing day\u2010to\u2010day tasks, shopping and personal\n                  care; there were no statistical differences between the number of respondents who\n                  found the services helpful \u2013 and unhelpful \u2013 in the areas of meals and nutrition;\n                  or maintaining their home environment.\nPersonal safety and security\nThe \u2018personal safety and security\u2019 domain is derived from the ASCOT \u2018personal safety\u2019\n               dimension, and the WHOQOL \u2018freedom, personal safety and security\u2019 facet from the environmental\n               domain. \u2018Privacy\u2019 was added as it is related to issues of security, particularly regarding\n               the Internet.\nMainstream ICT\nSeveral studies reported large proportions of older people owning a mobile phone for\n                  emergency use, with positive effects on sense of personal safety (Plaza\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Walsh & Callan\n2011\n, Martinez\u2010Pecino\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n). Conversely, several sources found negative effects of ICT on sense of privacy and\n                  personal security (Garceau\net\u00a0al\n.\n2007\n, Gatto & Tak\n2008\n, Leppel & McCloskey\n2011\n, Mason\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n). Some authors further exposed fears about becoming victims of abuse and crime when\n                  using ICT, and subsequent negative effects on personal sense of security.\nRemote care\nUnder \u2018ageing in place\u2019 principles, providing older people with a sense of personal\n                  safety and security is a fundamental purpose of ICT\u2010based care (Mahony & Mahony\n2010\n, Milligan\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Plaza\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n). Several studies described the positive effects of ICT\u2010based care on older users\u2019\n                  perception of safety. Williams\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) reported that 76% and 65% of respondents rated the localisation and emergency alarm\n                  applications respectively as \u2018important\u2019. Brownsell\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n) found that people in receipt of fall detection and lifestyle monitoring services\n                  reported improved feelings of safety compared to people without such services. Participants\n                  in a study by Walsh and Callan (\n2011\n) felt reassured by having pendant alarm services. Turgeon\u2010Londei\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2009\n) found that 96% of participants were favourable to video\u2010monitoring services that\n                  ensured personal safety in their homes. Chou\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2013\n) reported high ratings for \u2018feeling safe in daily life\u2019 among telehealth recipients.\n                  The MonAMI evaluation (Damant\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n) showed that a significantly greater number of participants perceived the technology\n                  services to be helpful rather than unhelpful for improving sense of safety and security\n                  in terms of falling, intrusion in the home and protecting belongings.\nSeveral sources discussed intrusiveness of ICT\u2010based care and related effects on privacy\n                  and personal security. Monitoring services, in particular, raised suspicions that\n                  \u2018Big Brother was watching\u2019, which could impinge on sense of personal freedom (Chan\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n, Demeris\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n, Age UK,\n2010\n, Mahony & Mahony\n2010\n, Matthews\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n, Wright & Wadhwa\n2010\n, Lorenzen\u2010huber\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Milligan\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n).\nConcerns regarding safeguarding of privacy were reflected in anxieties. Williams\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) found that 63% of participants were either \u2018very concerned\u2019 or \u2018slightly concerned\u2019\n                  about lack of privacy from 24\u2010hour monitoring services. A further 59% expressed concern\n                  about sending data to non\u2010medical staff for fear of crime and maleficence. Turgeon\u2010Londei\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2009\n) reported that 60% of their sample expressed a sense of intrusiveness into their\n                  private lives when considering the use of video\u2010monitoring equipment. Results from\n                  Nijland\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2009\n) also showed that 46% of the total sample (including younger adults) had doubts about\n                  the level of privacy of the email consultation (telemedicine) service. There was no\n                  significant difference between older and younger respondents.\nSocial involvement and participation\nSocial involvement and participation refers to the types and extent of personal relationships\n               in which individuals engage, and how they maintain these relationships.\nMainstream ICT\nSeveral sources noted that the primary benefit of older people's use of ICT was ability\n                  to maintain relationships with friends and family, and thereby gain social support\n                  (Age UK,\n2010\n; Choudrie\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n, Weaver\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n, Wright & Wadhwa\n2010\n, Bobillier Chaumon\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n).\nThere was considerable evidence of the positive effects of a range of ICT on social\n                  involvement with friends and family. Woodward\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) found an increase in perceived support from friends from older people participating\n                  in ICT training. Positive effects on social networks were associated with their use\n                  of mobile phones (Hurme\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n, Plaza\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Walsh & Callan\n2011\n, Martinez\u2010Pecino\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n), Skype (Woodward\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n), email (Gatto & Tak\n2008\n, Sayago & Blat\n2010\n, Bla\u017eun\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n, Mason\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n) and the Internet more generally (Adams\net\u00a0al\n.\n2005\n, Morris\net\u00a0al\n.\n2007\n, Gatto & Tak\n2008\n, Hill\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008\n, Sum\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008\n, Independent Age,\n2010\n, McMurtrey\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n).\nA secondary benefit of use of ICT to maintain involvement with families was described\n                  in terms of improving intergenerational relationships (Adams\net\u00a0al\n.\n2005\n, Holladay & Seipke\n2007\n, Hill\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008\n, Hurme\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n, Sayago & Blat\n2010\n, Bailey & Ngwenyama\n2011\n, Plaza\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Woodward\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n).\nThe effect of use of ICT on reducing loneliness was also a prominent theme in the\n                  literature. Mason\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2012\n) reported that older non\u2010users of the Internet were significantly more likely to\n                  say that they felt lonely compared to users. Similarly, older Internet users stated\n                  significantly more often that they hardly ever felt lonely, compared to older non\u2010users.\n                  Tsai\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) found that older people living in residential care significantly decreased their\n                  level of loneliness from baseline to follow\u2010up when using video\u2010conferencing equipment.\n                  Bla\u017eun\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2012\n) found that older people who used email and online forums, and who participated in\n                  a computer training course, significantly reduced their levels of loneliness. However\n                  there was no reported change in level of loneliness among participants who used Skype.\n                  Erickson and Johnson (\n2011\n) report a significant negative correlation between use of Internet applications such\n                  as email and online forums and loneliness. They also found a significantly positive\n                  relationship between Internet use and perceived social support.\nHowever, not all studies found a resoundingly positive association between older people's\n                  use of ICT and their social involvement and participation. Weaver\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) found that only a small minority of people used a computer to keep in contact with\n                  family; and they often did so reluctantly as it was the only way to remain in contact\n                  with their grandchildren. Koopman\u2010Boyden and Reid (\n2009\n) found no significant relationships between use of the Internet and email and contact\n                  with family and other people. Slegers\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n) revealed no significant effects between computer usage and training on the one hand,\n                  and loneliness and meeting with friends on the other. And Woodward\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) found that there were no statistically significant improvements in loneliness among\n                  participants who took part in an ICT training programme, although baseline loneliness\n                  levels were low.\nThere was also evidence of negative effects from ICT use on social involvement and\n                  participation. For instance, Huang's (\n2010\n) meta\u2010analysis (was not restricted to studies exclusively of older people) found\n                  an association between high Internet use and high levels of loneliness. Sum\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n) demonstrated that social loneliness was positively correlated with the amount of\n                  time older people spent using the Internet.\nThus, there were potentially both positive and negative outcomes for social networking\n                  for older people using ICT. At best, it could reinforce existing relationships, but\n                  there is no clear evidence of its impact on expanding social networks. For instance,\n                  Sayago and Blat (\n2010\n) and Bailey and Ngwenyama (\n2011\n) found that older people did not use email to make new friends, but rather relied\n                  on traditional methods perceived to be \u2018safer\u2019. Sum\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n) noted that using the Internet to communicate with new people was associated with\n                  increased levels of loneliness. On the other hand, Bla\u017eun\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2012\n) found significantly positive correlations between making new friends and sending\n                  emails and attending computer training respectively. The authors also noted a link\n                  between level of sociability at baseline and ability to establish new friendships\n                  using ICT during the study.\nRemote care\nThe topic of social involvement and participation in relation to ICT\u2010based care services\n                  frequently centres on the face\u2010to\u2010face contact between (older) patients and care practitioners.\n                  Many studies discussed reluctance among older adults to adopt ICT\u2010based care services\n                  for fear of losing the \u2018human touch\u2019 of traditional care services (Boonstra & van\n                  Offenbeek\n2010\n, Independent Age,\n2010\n, Matthews\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n; van Offenbeek & Boonstra\n2010\n, Lorenzen\u2010huber\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Sheaves\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Walsh & Callan\n2011\n, Chou\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n). Indeed, Milligan\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) pointed out that some older people deliberately made false alarms to gain social\n                  contact with care practitioners.\nThere is limited quantitative evidence of the effects of ICT\u2010based care on social\n                  involvement. Kim\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2009\n) found that face\u2010to\u2010face meetings between (older) patients and care practitioners\n                  were improved with use of electronic patient records. However, results were based\n                  on a very small sample (\nn\n=\u00a011). Brownsell\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n) found a slight improvement in the social functioning of older people using telecare\n                  at follow\u2010up compared to baseline, but improvements waned between 6\u2010 and 12\u2010month\n                  follow\u2010up periods. Damant\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2013\n) found no significant impact of remote alarm and monitoring services on social networking.\n                  Although participants tended to perceive the services as helpful in terms of speaking\n                  to people and receiving visitors, there was a tendency for participants to find the\n                  services unhelpful for reducing loneliness. Garceau\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2007\n) reported that one of four participants reported that telecare allowed them to continue\n                  receiving visitors to their home and to stay in contact with close friends and family;\n                  no participants found the services helpful towards meeting people\noutside\nof their home.\nOccupation\nOccupation includes all the many meaningful activities in which people engage, including\n               work, information\u2010seeking, hobbies and pastimes, leisure and entertainment.\nMainstream ICT\nThere was strong evidence to suggest that using ICT had a positive effect on older\n                  people's ability to carry out work, leisure, hobbies and information\u2010seeking activities\n                  (Selwyn\n2004\n, Morris\net\u00a0al\n.\n2007\n, Gatto & Tak\n2008\n, Slegers\net\u00a0al\n.\n2008\n, Choudrie\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n, Independent Age,\n2010\n, McMurtrey\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n).\nICT use has had an impact on the active participation in associations of all kinds\n                  including social, religious, political and tenant associations, clubs and organisations.\n                  Koopman\u2010Boyden and Reid (\n2009\n) noted that older Internet users were significantly more likely to take up leadership\n                  roles in social and community organisations. Participants were also more significantly\n                  likely to use the Internet if still employed, compared to those not employed. Harrod\n                  (\n2011\n) and Mukherjee (\n2011\n) presented qualitative findings on use of email and the Internet to co\u2010ordinate volunteering\n                  activities. Mason\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2012\n) found a significant association between using the Internet and being a member of\n                  political, religious, environmental, tenant and resident associations and groups.\n                  Cresci\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) found that older computer users were significantly more likely than non\u2010users to\n                  join community organisations and do volunteer work. Weaver\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) reported that \u2018younger\u2019 older participants perceived computers to be useful to occupy\n                  their time in the future, when they would be less physically active. Plaza\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) discussed the potential for ICT to enable older people to continue pursuing their\n                  hobbies at times when they have physical limitations.\nRemote care\nOnly one small study reported on the effects ICT\u2010based care on occupation: Garceau\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2007\n) noted that two out of four participants mentioned that the services had a positive\n                  effect on ability to carry out leisure activities.\nPsychological well\u2010being\nPsychological well\u2010being includes dignity, self\u2010esteem and self\u2010worth, and positive\n               and negative feelings.\nMainstream ICT\nSeveral qualitative studies described direct positive effects of using ICT on older\n                  people's well\u2010being. For instance, Sayago and Blat (\n2010\n) recounted the enjoyment and sense of purpose experienced when using email to communicate\n                  with loved ones. Sayago and Blat (\n2010\n), Hill\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n), Gatto and Tak (\n2008\n) and Independent Age (\n2010\n) also provided data about older people experiencing a \u2018sense of accomplishment\u2019,\n                  \u2018pride\u2019, feelings of empowerment and increased self\u2010esteem from using email and the\n                  Internet, and taking part in ICT training.\nIn addition, the\nIndependent Age\nreport (\n2010\n) suggested reported that older people felt mentally alert and challenged, and subsequently\n                  more youthful as a result of going online.\nThe effects of ICT use has also been measured quantitatively. Koopman\u2010Boyden and Reid\n                  (\n2009\n) reported a significant positive relationship between using the Internet and email\n                  and overall well\u2010being. Woodward\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) found older people who followed an ICT training programme had significantly higher\n                  self\u2010rated QOL compared to those who did not receive training. Tsai\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) reported a significant drop in depressive status for older people in residential\n                  care using a video\u2010conferencing service at 3\u2010month follow\u2010up. Erickson and Johnson's\n                  (\n2011\n) correlation analyses suggested a significant positive link between use of the Internet\n                  and life satisfaction, and a significant negative correlation between Internet use\n                  and depression. Slegers\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n) found that older people who were interested in \u2013 and used \u2013 a computer had significantly\n                  lower anxiety at baseline than older people who were not interested in using ICT.\n                  Finally, Cresci\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) found significantly higher levels of \u2018senior optimism\u2019 in older computer users compared\n                  to non\u2010users.\nOn the other hand, Mason\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2012\n) found only a weak association between anxiety and Internet use: older people who\n                  experienced anxiety were more likely to be non\u2010Internet users. Woodward\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) found no significant differences in depression between older adults who did or did\n                  not participate in ICT training, although their participants started with low depression\n                  levels.\nRemote care\nA few small\u2010sample qualitative studies have explored effects of older people's use\n                  of ICT\u2010based care on their sense of dignity. Age UK (\n2010\n) and Boonstra and van Offenbeek (\n2010\n) reported that telecare users perceived an increase in psychological well\u2010being from\n                  using services. Matthews\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n), Cardozo and Steinberg (\n2010\n), and Walsh and Callan (\n2011\n) discussed the reassurance that older people and their carers obtained through using\n                  ICT\u2010based care. Sheaves\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) found that all participants agreed to some degree that the Internet increased confidence\n                  in dealing with their long\u2010term condition. Brandt\net\u00a0al\n.'s (\n2011\n) review of telecare and smart home technology identified seven studies which considered\n                  the impact of the services on self\u2010esteem, happiness and self\u2010perceived QOL, the results\n                  demonstrating that overall, the services had positive effects.\nQuantitative studies showed mixed effects with respect to psychological well\u2010being.\n                  Damant\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2013\n) reported that significantly more participants of the MonAMI trial felt that remote\n                  monitoring and alert services were helpful (rather than unhelpful) in enabling them\n                  to feel optimistic about their future and reducing anxiety. The\nWhole Systems Demonstrator\n(WSD) trial reported that both telecare and telehealth services had no significant\n                  effect on anxiety or depression symptoms from baseline to 12\u2010month follow\u2010up (Cartwright\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n), but telecare had small, significant effects on reducing the rate of decline of\n                  mental health\u2010related QOL and depressive symptoms, although not on anxiety (Hirani\net\u00a0al\n.\n2014\n). Chou\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2013\n) suggested that telehealth enabled participants to experience less anxiety about\n                  their illness and experience fewer negative feelings more generally, but no tests\n                  of significance were reported.\nOn the other hand, both Brownsell\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n) and Bowes\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2009\n) found no significant effects on mental health scores from using telecare and tele\u2010monitoring\n                  services.\nClosely related to dignity are feelings associated with the obtrusiveness and subsequent\n                  stigmatising effects of using ICT\u2010based care. Zweijsen\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) broadly defined obtrusiveness of ICT\u2010based care as care which is disruptive or invasive\n                  of users\u2019 physical space, leading users to feel stigmatised or experience loss of\n                  dignity (Karunanithi\n2008\n, Age UK,\n2010\n). Several sources discussed how some monitoring services and wearable devices implied\n                  to older users that they were becoming increasingly frail, disabled and dependent\n                  (Sixsmith & Sixsmith\n2008\n, Roberts\n2009\n, Turgeon\u2010Londei\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n, Lloyd\n2010\n, Ding\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Zweijsen\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Wagner\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n). For instance, Walsh and Callan (\n2011\n) and Milligan\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) reported that older people were reluctant to wear their pendent alarms because they\n                  felt stigmatised as needing care and assistance. Williams\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) found that 41% of respondents were \u2018very concerned\u2019 or \u2018concerned\u2019 about \u2018carrying\n                  a device all day\u2019. Sanders\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2012\n) found that many people withdrew from the WSD trial because they associated telecare\n                  and telehealth with being dependent and in poor health, and they wanted to distance\n                  themselves from negative inferences of old age and illness.\nThe obtrusiveness of ICT also spurred discussions concerning the disappearing boundaries\n                  between the home and institutionalised care (Milligan\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n). Palm (\n2013\n) noted that a growing number of older people with care needs lived at home because\n                  they used ICT. However, as their needs grew and became more complicated, the \u2018home\u2019\n                  space became occupied by more equipment, aids and, indeed, care staff. Milligan\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) and Sixsmith and Sixsmith (\n2008\n) suggested that there is a risk that the home can shift from being an individuals\u2019\n                  personal sanctuary to an impersonal place of hurried activity.\nPhysical capability\nPhysical capability is the sixth domain of the combined QOL model. In this research,\n               it captures how use of ICT affects individuals\u2019 physical abilities to carry out their\n               daily activities. This extends to how ICT services effect individuals\u2019 health\u2010related\n               behaviour and knowledge, as well as their awareness of health issues that directly\n               affect physical capabilities.\nMainstream ICT\nVery few associations have been found between older people's use of mainstream ICT\n                  and their physical capabilities. Deloitte Centre for Health Solutions (\n2012\n) reported that approximately a third of all UK homes have a Wii Fit system at home\n                  and argued that this could be considered a form of telehealth if the vital sign data\n                  were transmitted to health clinicians. Gatto and Tak (\n2008\n) noted that most respondents found information on the Internet of little or no help\n                  as a resource for diet and exercise. Slegers\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n) found no consistent impact from older people's use of ICT on participation in physically\n                  active sports.\nWe searched for evidence on the extent to which older people used the Internet to\n                  carry out health information searches, as an indicator of health awareness and knowledge\n                  and self\u2010managed care. Several studies indicated that seeking health and medical information\n                  was one of the most common uses of ICT among the older population (Harrod\n2011\n, Bailey & Ngwenyama\n2011\n, McMurtrey\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Olson\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Robertson\u2010Lang\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Mason\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n, Chou\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n).\nGatto and Tak (\n2008\n) measured older people's perceptions of the helpfulness of online health information\n                  as a means of gaining knowledge about illness, treatments and therapies; approximately\n                  50% of respondents found the Internet helpful. Similarly, Sheaves\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) found that the majority of their participants were satisfied to some degree with\n                  the online information they obtained about their long\u2010term condition.\nApart from the above, the literature on ICT and health information focuses on barriers\n                  faced by older people when conducting health\u2010related online searches, such as their\n                  level of health and ICT\u2010related literacy and accessibility of websites.\nOn the other hand, there were observations from several countries concerning how older\n                  people's self\u2010rated health correlated with use of mainstream ICT. For instance, Gracia\n                  and Herrero (\n2009\n) found that older people living in Spain who use the Internet had significantly better\n                  self\u2010rated health than non\u2010users. In New Zealand, Koopman\u2010Boyden and Reid (\n2009\n) found a significant positive relationship between Internet and email usage and self\u2010rated\n                  health. An American study by Cresci\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) showed that computer users were significantly healthier than computer non\u2010users.\n                  Heart and Kalderon's (\n2013\n) Israeli\u2010American study also indicated a major effect of good health on computer\n                  use when interacting with age.\nRemote care\nBy design, ICT\u2010based care devices, services and systems compensate to some extent\n                  for physical, sensorial and cognitive limitations (Age UK,\n2010\n; Matthews\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n). Moreover, several ICT\u2010based care services provide health\u2010related information or\n                  include behaviour\u2010modification applications to assist self\u2010management of illness and\n                  care (van den Berg\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n). Williams\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) found that 56% and 50% of respondents (respectively) rated medicine reminder and\n                  vital sign monitoring features of remote care services as \u2018important\u2019. However, evidence\n                  of the effects of ICT\u2010based care on behaviour, knowledge and control over health issues\n                  is limited and at times contradictory.\nvan den Berg\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2012\n) and Aalbers\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n) conducted comprehensive systematic reviews of ICT\u2010based home care and Internet\u2010mediated\n                  interventions respectively. They concluded that there was a trend towards improvement\n                  in health\u2010related behaviour such as medication compliance, weight and disease management\n                  for older service users, although reported changes were often not significant or were\n                  short\u2010term. Bowes\net al\n. (\n2009\n) found that telehealth users did not have significantly different medication adherence\n                  compared to a control group receiving more face\u2010to\u2010face nurse visits.\nChou\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2013\n) showed that older people felt that they had improved knowledge about, and more control\n                  over, their health by using telehealth. Participants highly rated the services in\n                  terms of \u2018distraction due to pain\u2019. Bowes\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2009\n) also observed significant improvements in medication knowledge among users of telehealth\n                  services who also received frequent nurse visits.\nIn terms of self\u2010rated health, Brownsell\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2008\n) and Hirani\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2014\n) reported no significant improvements for older people using telecare over a year.\n                  Similarly, Bowes\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2009\n) and Cartwright\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2013\n) did not find significant effects on self\u2010rated health for people using telehealth\n                  services. The MonAMI evaluation showed that significantly more participants found\n                  the telecare services to be \u2018unhelpful\u2019 than \u2018helpful\u2019 in terms of feeling energetic,\n                  managing their medication and memory. A similar trend was observed for perceptions\n                  of the services\u2019 lack of helpfulness for managing pain (Damant\net\u00a0al\n.\n2013\n).\nDiscussion\nOur review suggests that older people's use of ICT brings many benefits to QOL. In\n            particular, some older people achieve a sense of control and independence over their\n            daily lives, reinforce their social networks, gain a sense of safety, pursue pastimes\n            and other meaningful activities, and improve overall psychological well\u2010being.\nYet the benefits were not universal. Findings were especially varied for social involvement\n            and participation, personal safety and security, and psychological well\u2010being. For\n            social involvement and participation, while overall the results from qualitative studies\n            suggested that ICT use had positive impacts on family contacts and intergenerational\n            relationships, weak, negative or insignificant effects on loneliness, visiting and\n            general social functioning were most often reported in quantitative studies. In fact,\n            some findings implied that ICT use could negatively affect QOL by exacerbating feelings\n            of loneliness. Therefore, contrary to the assumption that engagement with ICT is essential\n            for older people to remain socially active and to combat loneliness, the evidence\n            could be said to imply that use of ICT positively reinforces existing social networks,\n            but generally has no effect on building new ones.\nThe analyses for personal safety and security further confirmed that the benefits\n            of ICT use are often uncertain. Several sources claimed that ICT use, in different\n            contexts, improved perceptions of personal safety and security, especially from using\n            a mobile telephone. However these claims are not completely substantiated upon closer\n            investigation of the evidence, as there were several issues around privacy, intrusiveness\n            and data protection that many older people are uncomfortable with, particularly when\n            considering ICT services using the Internet and video equipment.\nEvidence on psychological well\u2010being for ICT use in a care context was similarly mixed.\n            While the overall effects of ICT use on this domain in mainstream contexts are positive,\n            the effects of ICT in care contexts are more negative. This division between mainstream\n            and care\u2010related applications may link to findings regarding physical capability,\n            which suggests a positive association between older people's health state and ICT\n            use. In the same vein, participants in studies of ICT\u2010base care services have care\n            needs and likely some form of limiting illness or disability that may influence access\n            to, and use of ICT, suggesting that the observed effects of ICT use on psychological\n            well\u2010being could reflect a person's state of health or general favourable disposition,\n            rather than the use of ICT itself. This sustains Koopman\u2010Boyden and Reid (\n2009\n)'s queries about the direction of causality, where the QOL outcomes associated with\n            technology use may be shrouded by users\u2019 baseline conditions for adopting ICT in the\n            first place.\nOverall, the mixed findings on effects on QOL lend support to the conclusions of Dickinson\n            and Gregor (\n2006\n), Weaver\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2010\n) and Plaza\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2011\n), who challenged the common assumption that older people's use of ICT enhances QOL.\n            It would be wrong to assume that there is a technology solution to every social problem,\n            particularly with respect to a generation of older \u2018digital immigrants\u2019, for many\n            of whom ICT plays only a tangential role in their daily lives (Hernandez\u2010Encuentra\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n, Vodanovich\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n, Dutton & Blank\n2013\n).\nImplications\nThe complicated nature of relationships between ICT use and QOL suggests that trade\u2010offs\n               are made: benefits of using ICT in one domain are weighed against disadvantages in\n               another domain (Wright & Wadhwa\n2010\n). Several reports discussed concessions some people are willing to make in terms\n               of privacy and security in order to live independently in their own homes with the\n               use of monitoring services (Sixsmith & Sixsmith\n2008\n, Blaschke\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n, Turgeon\u2010Londei\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n, Matthews\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n, Gonz\u00e1lez\u2010Vega\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Zweijsen\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Wagner\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n). Gaining a level of independence and sense of security might be achieved at the\n               expense of face\u2010to\u2010face contact with care practitioners. Continuous surveillance and\n               monitoring services which offer security and independence could force older people\n               to sacrifice personal autonomy as they lose the ability to choose when to use services\n               and what personal information is shared with others. Mahony and Mahony (\n2010\n) commented on the trade\u2010off between the reliability of wearable monitoring services\n               and the stigmatising effects of services for people living with dementia.\nIn the\nCare Act 2014\n(Department of Health,\n2014\n), the English government renewed its commitment to personalised care, and promoted\n               ICT\u2010based care as a way to achieve this aim. However, the evidence analysed here suggests\n               widespread concerns that ICT\u2010based care intended to promote independence (and save\n               costs) could inhibit older people's pursuit of human contact and social involvement\n               (Lloyd\n2010\n), and could have a detrimental effect on overall QOL (Sixsmith & Sixsmith\n2008\n).\nThe lack of resoundingly positive evidence also reflects challenges in integrating\n               social outcomes within ICT\u2010based care, as the primary aim of the latter is not to\n               provide human care, but rather to complement existing face\u2010to\u2010face services (Demeris\net\u00a0al\n.\n2009\n, Boonstra & van Offenbeek\n2010\n, Independent Age,\n2010\n; Milligan\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Sanders\net\u00a0al\n.\n2012\n). Given that on balance the results on the effects of ICT use on a singular domain\n               of QOL are inconclusive, introducing the concept of trade\u2010offs offers an alternative\n               for understanding QOL in this context. Providing a more balanced and realistic description\n               of the benefits could help ICT service developers and providers to build appropriate\n               support services which would both encourage the uptake of ICT as well as compensate\n               for aspects of QOL compromised by the technology.\nFuture research\nOur findings expose a number of topics around QOL and ICT which need further exploration.\n               First, the combined QOL framework used in our review proved useful in organising evidence.\n               It helped underscore that the evidence on ICT\u2010based care is limited and inconsistent.\n               van den Berg\net\u00a0al\n.'s (\n2012\n) review of ICT\u2010based care services also showed that fewer than a fifth of 68 eligible\n               studies measured QOL. This may be attributable to the difficulties in both defining\n               and isolating the social outcomes which can be addressed by technology, especially\n               given their overlap and interconnectedness (Dickens\net al\n.\n2011\n).\nA limitation of our model lies in its usefulness in detecting the effects of ICT use\n               on physical capabilities. Overall, there was little evidence which corresponded to\n               how the physical capabilities domain was defined in the combined QOL framework. Agree\n               and Freedman (\n2011\n) pilot\u2010tested the Assistive Technology Quality of Life Scale, yielding similarly\n               ambiguous results on the role of assistive technologies in reducing pain, fatigue\n               and ability to carry out day\u2010to\u2010day activities. The findings may be attributable to\n               difficulties of directly attributing alleviation of physical symptoms to use of ICT\u2010based\n               devices or services. Results may also be an artefact of sample selection, where the\n               baseline health state of participants is relatively good, causing a ceiling effect.\n               Difficulties with evaluating the relationship between ICT use and physical capabilities\n               also lie with the available body of instrumentation, which is neither adequately sensitive\n               nor specific to assess QOL outcomes.\nSecond, in several cases, quantitative measurements of older people's QOL yielded\n               mostly insignificant results highlighting methodological challenges in uncovering\n               causal relationships between technology use and the subjective aspects of QOL. Both\n               device use and psychological well\u2010being, for instance, are affected by some extraneous\n               factors which cannot be easily isolated or explained using strict research protocols\n               typically associated with quantitative research (Robson\n2011\n, p. 21). For instance, Hirani\net\u00a0al\n. (\n2014\n) suggested the mixed quantitative findings for the effects of using ICT\u2010based care\n               on psychological well\u2010being could reflect the complexity of emotions that many older\n               people experience when managing an illness or long\u2010term need. Therefore, unpicking\n               these complex human experiences through exploratory qualitative research may provide\n               better insight into the effects of ICT (Pawson\net\u00a0al\n.\n2005\n).\nFinally, the many older people who do not use ICT are underrepresented in research,\n               making it difficult to ascertain how their QOL and ability to participate in their\n               communities are improved or compromised by not using ICT, as well as to hypothesise\n               how their QOL would change if they used ICT. Indeed, we found evidence that many older\n               people do not participate in ICT\u2010based leisure and diversion activities or use social\n               networking sites (Choudrie\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n, Weaver\net\u00a0al\n.\n2010\n, McMurtrey\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n, Plaza\net\u00a0al\n.\n2011\n), although these are older studies and the context is changing rapidly. There is\n               a need for a concerted effort to include older non\u2010users in empirical research and\n               to investigate their QOL within the context of the digital society.\nLimitations\nOur review has limitations. Overall, scoping reviews are more inclusive than systematic\n               reviews, both in terms of sources of information searched, and in terms of the range\n               of research methods used to garner the evidence. Therefore, in comparison to studies\n               included in a systematic review, there will be more variability in the \u2018quality\u2019 of\n               studies included a scoping review, especially when using hierarchal quality frameworks\n               which often have a quantitative bias. Also, given range and complexity of the topics\n               around older people's use of ICT and QOL, the scope of our review was broad and the\n               investigation of the related subtopics may be less comprehensive than with a more\n               focused review.\nTaking a pragmatic approach to literature reviewing also highlighted the diversity\n               in how each main issue of this study is defined. For instance, \u2018older age\u2019 was defined\n               very differently across studies, the meaning of ICT similarly varied a lot, and as\n               discussed QOL also have many meanings. To understand the context of ICT use and QOL,\n               the parameters of this research were defined broadly.\nFinally, there is always delay in evidence appearing in the peer\u2010reviewed literature.\n               Given the fast\u2010moving nature of digital technologies, published results may not fully\n               reflect current reality. In particular, many adults today contemplating moving into\n               the \u2018older age\u2019 category rely much more extensively on ICT in their daily lives than\n               do today's older people; their experiences and expectations of a \u2018digital society\u2019\n               in old age will likely differ considerably.\nConclusion\nOverall, the evidence suggests that older people's ICT use has both positive and negative\n            effects on QOL; and when they \u2018trade\u2010off\u2019 the constructive and obstructive aspects\n            of technology, it can facilitate their participation in social networks and communities.\n            However, the topic of older people's engagement with the digital society remains largely\n            under\u2010researched; in particular, more attention should be given to development of\n            appropriate research instruments and inclusion of older\nnon\n\u2010users.\nAcknowledgements\nThis review was part of a wider scoping study of digital inclusion of older people\n            funded by the NIHR School for Social Care Research.

This study is highly important,\n            considering the potential differences in disease manifestations which may exist across\n            the globe based on race or culture.\nThe good news is that Zhong\net al\n.\n1\ndemonstrate that, analogous to the global trials, tiotropium Respimat 5\u2009\u00b5g and HandiHaler\n            18\u2009\u00b5g have similar safety and exacerbation efficacy in the Asian cohort. However,\n            far more interesting is that they observed remarkable differences in background clinical\n            characteristics and some clinical outcomes between the Asian cohort and the rest of\n            the world. Patients in Asia had fewer but more severe exacerbations than those from\n            the rest of the world. Fewer exacerbations in COPD have been repeatedly reported in\n            Asia, particularly in Japan.\n2\n,\n3\nVariations in the characteristics and symptoms of patients with COPD as well as their\n            treatment outcomes have also been reported, even among cities within Asia\n4\nwith differences in exposure to biomass fuels and/or air pollution. Healthcare system\n            and/or access to medical care would further contribute to such variations in the clinical\n            manifestation. The observation of more severe exacerbations in Asian COPD patients\n            might be explained by these differences.\nAnother intriguing finding in this study is that apparently the co\u2010morbidity spectrum\n            and causes of death in Asian COPD patients differed despite similar all\u2010cause mortality.\n            There was less cardiovascular disease in the background and cardiac death occurred\n            less frequently in Asia. These findings may be linked to a lower average BMI (22)\n            in Asia, which is in sharp contrast with BMI\u2009of\u200926.9 in the rest of the world. A recently\n            published Japanese review\n5\nhighlighted remarkable differences in the co\u2010morbidity spectrum of Japanese patients\n            compared with Western counterparts. In addition, Japanese COPD patients appear to\n            be generally older when entering similar clinical trials,\n2\n,\n6\nand their quality of life scores and prognosis appear better despite similar pulmonary\n            function impairment.\n2\n,\n6\n,\n7\nSo, why is awareness of regional/racial differences in clinical characteristics of\n            COPD patients important? In recent years, the progress in medical science and technology\n            has been astounding and we are fortunate to have access to these advancements wherever\n            we are in the world. We often find ourselves easily convinced and persuaded by large\u2010scale,\n            multicentre global studies. However, for Japanese respiratory physicians, it is not\n            uncommon to feel a certain uneasiness when we encounter such highly influential studies,\n            partly because the majority of participants in these global studies tend to come from\n            Western societies. \u2018Phenotyping\u2019 driven by associated biomarker discovery is a fashionable\n            term to differentiate the variable forms and clinical manifestations of common diseases\n            such as asthma and COPD. This is because we tend to feel that precise phenotyping\n            may lead to precise medicine, in other words, to personalized medicine in the future.\n            Large\u2010scale, multicentre, randomized clinical trials may provide us with high\u2010quality\n            evidence, but the data do not always give us the best answer for the individual patient.\nAs respiratory physicians, we see patients with a variety of lung diseases, and we\n            know that remarkable phenotypic differences exist not only in COPD but also in other\n            major lung diseases. Acute exacerbations in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has been\n            considered by the Japanese Respiratory Society for many years as a major threatening\n            event, even a cause of death, but has only recently been recognized as such in Western\n            societies. In patients with severe asthma, serious concerns surround the elderly,\n            many of whom are smokers with or without COPD. In lung cancer, it is well known that\n            the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driver mutation is much more prevalent\n            in non\u2010smoking Asian women compared with their Western counterparts, which certainly\n            accounts for a favourable response to a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor in the\n            former ethnic group.\n8\nThese clinical characteristics of Japanese patients (and potentially other Asian\n            patients as well) may or may not be linked to genetic differences. In some patients,\n            environmental/social factors may dominantly influence phenotypic expressions. Evidence\n            for this can be seen in the dramatic changes in the phenotype of COPD over the last\n            three decades. In the past, many patients used to complain of voluminous sputum and\n            having to be hospitalized because of exacerbations, particularly in the winter. Yet,\n            we rarely see those patients with bronchial hypersecretion. Far more dramatic is the\n            case of diffuse panbronchiolitis, which used to be found exclusively in East Asia.\n            Nowadays, it is rarely seen in Japan.\nConsidering such remarkable phenotypic differences between the East and the West,\n            even among regions within Asia, it would indeed be an excellent opportunity and an\n            exciting challenge for precise medicine. I hope that by studying the mechanisms behind\n            the phenotypic differences described, we may help establish and further develop precise\n            and/or personalized medicine.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

We aimed to investigate the severity and clinical\n               outcomes of COPD in patients with and without a history of TB.\nMethods\nWe retrospectively reviewed the data of 1784 patients with COPD in the Korean COPD Subtype Study cohort collected from December 2011 to January 2017 and followed up\n               for 3\u2009years.\nResults\nAmong the 1784 patients at baseline, the COPD assessment test (CAT) scores and total St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQc) scores were significantly higher in the prior TB group (\nn\n=\u2009468) than in the non\u2010TB group (\nn\n=\u20091316). Lung function and exacerbation prevalence were significantly poorer and\n               higher, respectively, in the prior TB group than in the non\u2010TB group. In a small\u2010sized follow\u2010up study, CAT scores (\nn\n=\u2009318), SGRQc scores (\nn\n=\u2009295) and lung function (\nn\n=\u2009182) remained poorer, and exacerbation prevalence (\nn\n=\u2009256) remained higher in the prior TB group over 3\u2009years.

In the prior TB group, patients showed poorer lung function compared with the non\u2010TB group regardless of having lung lesions visible or not on chest radiographs.\nConclusion\nTB history negatively affected the severity of COPD, and a small\u2010sized follow\u2010up study showed that the changes were sustained for several\n               years.\nINTRODUCTION\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is considered a serious health problem\n            worldwide. COPD morbidity and mortality have been increasing because of ageing societies,\n            increased smoking prevalence and air pollution, and lead to high health costs.\n1\n-\n5\nCOPD is characterized by chronic inflammation induced by toxic particles and gases\n            resulting in progressive and irreversible airway obstruction characterized by bronchitis\n            and emphysema. Cigarette smoking and ageing are well\u2010known major risk factors for\n            the development of COPD.\n6\n-\n9\nIn addition, recent studies have reported that biomass smoke,\n10\nthe microbiome,\n11\nnutritional absorption,\n12\nmitochondrial damage\n13\nand even genetic factors\n14\ncontribute to and/or aggravate COPD.\nPulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was suggested to be one of the causes of COPD in the 1950s.\n15\nThe Latin American Project for the Investigation of Obstructive Lung Disease (PLATINO)\n            study in 2007 showed that a history of TB was significantly associated with airflow\n            obstruction.\n16\nMoreover, a large Chinese cohort study revealed that TB was an independent risk factor\n            for airflow obstruction.\n17\nHealth insurance databases in Taiwan showed the same results and demonstrated that\n            the prompt initiation of anti\u2010TB treatment may prevent COPD. A recent Korean study\n            showed that subjects with a TB history without sequelae on chest imaging were vulnerable\n            to pulmonary function impairment and respiratory symptoms.\n18\nWhile an association between TB and COPD has been reported in some cross\u2010sectional\n            studies and meta\u2010analyses, there were limitations in showing causality. Moreover,\n            a serial follow\u2010up of symptomatic changes, lung function decline and COPD exacerbation\n            rates according to TB history has never been performed.\nThis study aimed to investigate the severity and clinical outcomes of COPD in patients\n            with history of TB compared with patients with no such history who were followed up\n            for 3\u2009years.\nMETHODS\nData collection\nWe analysed data from the Korean COPD Subtype Study (KOCOSS) cohort collected from\n               45 study centres throughout Korea.\n19\nRecruitment, enrolment and measurement occurred between December 2011 and January\n               2017. Enrolment criteria for the KOCOSS were Korean adults \u226540\u2009years old with a post\u2010bronchodilator\n               forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009s (FEV\n1\n)/forced vital capacity (FVC) value <0.7 at any clinical visit. The history of treatment\n               for COPD was overlooked for inclusion. The exclusion criteria were inability to perform\n               the pulmonary function test, use of systemic steroids because of other underlying\n               diseases, and inability to communicate with clinicians. Demographic data, smoking\n               history and status and co\u2010morbidities were assessed at the first visit. TB history\n               was also included in the questionnaire. The question specific for TB history was:\n               \u2018Have you ever been diagnosed with TB?\u2019 Prior TB group was defined based on this questionnaire\n               regardless of the chest X\u2010ray (CXR) findings. All data were collected by trained nurses,\n               and patients attended follow\u2010up visits at regular 6\u2010month intervals.\nThis KOCOSS cohort is still ongoing; for the follow\u2010up analysis, we included all the\n               patients who have a full data set with at least 3\u2009years of follow\u2010up. The study protocol\n               was approved by the institutional review board at each centre. All patients provided\n               written informed consent for participation in the study.\nCAT and SGRQ scores\nThe COPD assessment test (CAT) score\n20\nand St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQc) score\n21\nwere used to assess symptoms, quality of life and health status in patients with\n               COPD.\nExacerbation definition\nExacerbations were defined as the worsening of any respiratory symptom, such as increased\n               sputum volume, purulence or increased dyspnoea, which required treatment with systemic\n               corticosteroids, antibiotics or both. Exacerbation history in the previous 12\u2009months\n               was assessed at the first visit and at the 1\u2010, 2\u2010 and 3\u2010year follow\u2010up visits based\n               on a self\u2010reported survey. Severe exacerbation was defined as the exacerbation requiring\n               hospital admission including general ward, emergency room or intensive care unit (ICU).\n               The prevalences of exacerbation and severe exacerbation were calculated according\n               to the proportion of subjects among the total number of subjects who had experienced\n               at least one exacerbation event or severe exacerbation event during the last year\n               prior to enrolment.\nLung function and CXR\nPulmonary function tests including FVC, post\u2010bronchodilator FEV\n1\n, post\u2010bronchodilator FEV\n1\n/FVC, forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the FVC (FEF\n25\u201375%\n), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DL\nCO\n) and DL\nCO\n/alveolar volume (VA) were conducted at 1\u2010year intervals for 3\u2009years. CXR was interpreted\n               by the radiology department affiliated with each institute. A TB lesion was defined\n               as a lesion with fibrosis (linear or reticulofibrotic opacities) located in the upper\n               lung, as previously reported.\n22\nStatistical analysis\nFor continuous variables, descriptive statistics are reported as means with SD, and\n               for categorical variables, as the number of patients per category and the frequency\n               of responses. Comparisons of continuous variables were analysed using a two\u2010sample\n               t\u2010test and analysis of variance (ANOVA); chi\u2010square tests were used for comparisons\n               of categorical variables. Comparisons of symptom scores and FEV\n1\nchanges were assessed with a repeated ANOVA to compare the prognoses and changes\n               in these variables during the follow\u2010up period. Differences were considered statistically\n               significant at\nP\n<\u20090.05.\nRESULTS\nClinical characteristics according to TB history\nAmong the 1839 patients enrolled, 1784 patients were analysed in this study. Among\n               them, 1316 patients had no TB history (non\u2010TB group), whereas 468 patients had a TB\n               history (prior TB group). A subset of the patients were followed up serially over\n               3\u2009years as regards to symptoms, lung function and exacerbation history (Fig.\n1\n).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nStudy flow.

However, there was\n               no statistically significant difference between them (\nP\nfor changes between the groups\u2009=\u20090.076) (Fig.\n2\nD).\nChanges in exacerbation prevalence according to TB history\nAmong the 256 patients followed up for exacerbation history for 3\u2009years, 73 and 183\n               patients were classified into the prior TB group and non\u2010TB group, respectively. The\n               prevalence of subjects who experienced a COPD exacerbation over the last 1\u2009year in\n               the prior TB group (20.5%) at baseline was slightly higher than that in the non\u2010TB\n               group (18.0%) and increased and remained higher after 3\u2009years (27.4% vs 23.5%, respectively).\n               However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups.\n               Moreover, changes in exacerbation prevalence over the 3\u2009years were not significantly\n               different between the two groups (\nP\nfor changes between the groups\u2009=\u20090.965) (Fig.\nS1\n, Supplementary Information).\nComparisons of lung function in prior TB group between those with and without lung lesions\nWe divided the prior TB group according to the presence of lung lesions on CXR. Ninety\u2010seven\n               patients demonstrated no lesion on CXR, whereas 115 patients had a definite lesion\n               on CXR. Compared with the non\u2010TB group, FEV\n1\nwas lower in prior TB group subjects with and without lesions. Moreover, lung function\n               was similar in the prior TB group between subjects with lesions on CXR and those without\n               (Fig.\nS2\n, Supplementary Information).\nDISCUSSION\nWe showed that COPD patients with a history of TB had more severe symptoms, poorer\n            lung function and more frequent exacerbations, and that these differences were sustained\n            for several years compared with those with no TB history. Although there are many\n            studies concerning TB as a cause,\n23\nco\u2010morbidity\n16\n,\n24\nand aggravating factor for COPD\n25\nas mentioned in the 2017 GOLD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease) guidelines,\n26\nstudies comparing the severity and clinical outcomes of COPD serially according to\n            TB history are extremely rare. TB can lead to remodelling of the lung parenchyma including\n            cavitation, fibrosis, bronchiectasis and lung destruction.\n27\nMany studies suggested that these structural damages to the lung in TB patients were\n            an important factor in the development of COPD.\n28\n-\n30\nTang\net al\n. showed that the impaired cellular immunity in COPD patients can be more serious\n            when it is complicated by TB.\n31\nHowever, the serial effects of TB on the severity and clinical outcomes of COPD over\n            several years had never been studied before now.\nAlthough statistically significant results were not obtained because of the limited\n            number of patients available for serial follow\u2010up, we found that lung function decline\n            in patients with a TB history may be faster than in patients with no TB history. This\n            result suggests that subjects with a TB history have not only poor lung function temporarily,\n            but also a poor lung function outcome. There have been some reports that described\n            the adverse effect of TB on lung function.\n32\nA recent study demonstrated that adverse effects of TB on lung function (FEV\n1\nand PaCO\n2\n) were also applicable to COPD patients.\n25\nAnother interesting finding in this study is that prior TB group subjects without\n            lung lesions on CXR showed similar lung function to those with lung lesions on CXR.\n            Jung\net al\n.\n18\nrevealed that subjects without lesions on CXR showed impaired pulmonary function\n            and respiratory symptoms along with subjects with lesions. TB sequelae or microscopic\n            lesions might not always be detectable by CXR and might need computed tomography (CT)\n            scans or further analysis, therefore a prior diagnosis of TB should be considered\n            as a risk factor, even when patients do not present with a lesion on CXR.\nPatients with a TB history showed a significantly lower prevalence of current smoking\n            than did patients with no TB history. Moreover, they had lighter smoking histories.\n            The patients\u2019 TB history might have played a role in this observation.\nTB is a treatable and curable disease. However, TB is one of the world's largest causes\n            of morbidity and mortality. All patients with a history of TB should be educated by\n            clinicians, especially in countries where TB is prevalent, to take particular care\n            of their lungs, including stopping smoking and undergoing close monitoring of lung\n            function. Korea is a country with an intermediate TB burden. This study thus included\n            a large portion of subjects with a prior TB history among COPD patients. Longer term\n            follow\u2010up data from this study will show more powerful results concerning clinical\n            outcomes and prognosis.\nThere are some limitations to this study. First, this study included limited information\n            concerning TB, for example, the age at TB onset, treatment history for TB, TB drug\n            susceptibility or the types and results of treatment. Second, the classification of\n            CXR lesions is not fully consistent because it was provided by different institutions.\n            Third, only a small number of patients completed the entire 3\u2010year follow\u2010up study\n            which limited the validity of results on the longitudinal change in symptoms, lung\n            function and exacerbations. Fourth, the information concerning TB history and exacerbation\n            was obtained based on the self\u2010reported questionnaire. Lastly, the treatment history\n            for COPD varied at enrolment. However, the prevalence of treatment\u2010na\u00efve patient was\n            small (<10%) and was not different according to the group. Further long\u2010term and larger\n            cohort studies will be helpful to compare the severity and clinical outcomes of COPD\n            according to TB history.\nIn conclusion, COPD patients with a TB history showed more severe symptoms, poorer\n            lung function and more frequent exacerbations.

Attention and memory deficits also proved to impair psychosocial adjustment (Shehata\n            et\u00a0al.,\n2009\n; Gois et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n), but they did not predict QoL (Gois et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n).\nTheory of mind (ToM), an ability to mentally represent one's own and others' epistemic\n            and affective mental states (Shamay\u2010Premack & Woodroof, 1978; Baron\u2010Cohen et\u00a0al.,\n1994\n; Stone et\u00a0al.,\n1998\n; Shamay\u2010Tsoory & Aharon\u2010Peretz,\n2007\n), provides information for guiding one's own social conduct and understanding the\n            behavior of others. Adults are credited with a ToM if they are able to recognize a\n            false belief by realizing that another individual's mental states have no basis in\n            reality or differ from representations pertaining to the self (Brass et\u00a0al.,\n2009\n). Therefore, ToM allows one to distinguish real mental states from persuasion, metaphor,\n            irony, lie, or delusion. Indeed, in neurologic or psychiatric conditions in the absence\n            of epilepsy, ToM deficits showed a relationship to different psychopathologic symptoms\n            (Gregory et\u00a0al.,\n2002\n; Grisham et\u00a0al.,\n2010\n; Koelkebeck et\u00a0al.,\n2010\n; Mehl et\u00a0al.,\n2010\n). In PWE, ToM deficits were strictly associated with age of seizure onset, presence\n            of temporolimbic damage, and disease duration (Schacher et\u00a0al.,\n2006\n; Giovagnoli et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n), and they constituted a specific cognitive factor (Giovagnoli et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n). In these patients, the clinical impact of ToM impairment was minimally considered\n            (Farrant et\u00a0al.,\n2005\n; Schacher et\u00a0al.,\n2006\n; Shaw et\u00a0al.,\n2007\n; Giovagnoli et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n; Broicher et\u00a0al.,\n2012\n).\nGiven the demands on clinical care by epilepsy\u2010related psychobehavioral difficulties,\n            it is of great interest to learn more about their causes. ToM plays a role in determining\n            different psychopathologic aspects in nonepilepsy patients. It is possible that ToM\n            deficits contribute to cause the psychobehavioral distress and impoverishment of QoL\n            of PWE. In particular, an impaired capacity to understand mental states and to comprehend\n            interpersonal relations could affect self\u2010appraisal and adaptation capacities. This\n            study evaluated ToM with the goal of clarifying its relation to cognitive self\u2010evaluation,\n            coping with stressful events, and selective QoL domains. To our knowledge, this is\n            the first investigation assessing such aspects in patients with epilepsy.\nMethods\nSubjects' description\nSixty\u2010six patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE; n\u00a0=\u00a054) or frontal lobe epilepsy\n               (FLE; n\u00a0=\u00a012) were selected on the basis of clinical and electroencephalography (EEG)\n               findings (Berg et\u00a0al.,\n2010\n). Patients with major depression, psychosis, or mental retardation were excluded\n               on the basis of psychiatric interview, school accomplishment, and the level of education\n               attained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected focal lesions congruent with the\n               location indicated by clinical and EEG diagnosis in 48 patients with TLE and 10 patients\n               with FLE. Medial temporal lobe sclerosis (MTLS) was found in 18 patients with left\n               and 15 patients with right TLE. Dysplasia, cavernomas, or low\u2010grade gliomas were detected\n               in the medial temporal region in seven TLE patients, and in the lateral temporal area\n               in eight TLE patients. Frontal lobe lesions included two cavernomas, two dysplasia,\n               three posttraumatic atrophic lesions, and three vascular lesions. Patients with FLE\n               and patients with TLE did not differ in disease duration, age of seizure onset, seizure\n               frequency, and the number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).\nForty\u2010two healthy controls, selected from the hospital staff and patients' relatives,\n               underwent the neuropsychological testing. PWE and controls showed the same chronological\n               age, gender distribution, and schooling (Table\n1\n).\nTable 1.\nCharacteristics of PWE and controls\nAll patients N\u00a0=\u00a066\nTLE patients N\u00a0=\u00a054\nFLE patients N\u00a0=\u00a012\nHealthy controls N\u00a0=\u00a042\nFemales/males\n34/32\n28/26\n6/6\n24/18\nSchooling (years)\n11.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.41 (5\u201318)\n11.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.47\n11.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.25\n11.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.38 (3\u201318)\nAge\n37.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.98 (18\u201365)\n37.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.20\n37.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.41\n40\u201364\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.61\nDisease duration\n17.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.84 (1\u201350)\n18.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.04\n11.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.53\nAge of seizure onset\n19.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.06 (1\u201355)\n18.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.48\n25.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.92\nMonthly seizure frequency (previous 6\u00a0months)\n10.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.23 (0\u201390)\n9.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.69\n14.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030.57\nNumber of AEDs\n2.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92 (1\u20135)\n2.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.88\n2.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.14\nFocal lesions\n58\n48\n10\nPWE, patients with epilepsy; TLE, temporal lobe epilepsy; FLE, frontal lobe epilepsy;\n                        AED, antiepileptic drug.\nNeuropsychological measurements\nToM was evaluated using the Faux Pas Task (FPT; Stone et\u00a0al.,\n1998\n). The FPT performance, which is normally solved at age 11\u201312, can be significantly\n               impaired by TLE and FLE (Giovagnoli et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n). It requires the recognition or exclusion of social faux pas (FP) in 20 short stories.\n               After reading each story, a subject is asked the detection question: \u201cDid anyone say\n               something they shouldn't have said?\u201d If they answer \u201cyes,\u201d they are asked four comprehension\n               questions (\u201cWho said something they shouldn't have said?,\u201d \u201cWhy shouldn't he/she have\n               said what he/she did?,\u201d \u201cWhy did he/she say that?,\u201d \u201cHow did he/she feel?\u201d) that investigate\n               the identification of the character making the FP, comprehension of mental states\n               and social interactions before judging the behavior's adequacy, comprehension of intentions,\n               and comprehension of affective mental states. A control question is asked at the end\n               of each story to verify that the subject has kept in mind the contextual details.\n               Two detection (FP recognition, non\u2010FP exclusion), four comprehension, and two control\n               scores are computed (score ranges: 0\u201310).\nThe Digit Span, Corsi Blocks Span, Short Story, Rey Complex Figure Delayed Recall\n               (RCFDR), Attentive Matrices, Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B, Raven Colored Progressive\n               Matrices (RCPM), Weigl Sorting Test, and Word Fluency Test (WFT) on phonemic or semantic\n               cues evaluated different cognitive abilities (Giovagnoli et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n).\nMeasurements of cognitive self\u2010evaluation, coping, mood, and QoL\nThe Multiple Ability Self\u2010report Questionnaire (MASQ; Seidenberg et\u00a0al.,\n1994\n) comprises 38 questions that explore the subjective perception of cognitive abilities\n               (language, visual\u2010perceptual abilities, verbal and visual memory, attention/concentration).\n               Each subscale contains eight questions, except for the visual\u2010perceptual abilities\n               subscale, which contains six. One to five points are attributed to each answer in\n               relation to the frequency (almost always, often, sometimes, seldom, almost never)\n               of specific difficulties. The total score (38\u2013190) is the sum of all subscale scores,\n               and gives an index of everyday failures: the higher the total score, the more severe\n               the perceived impairment.\nThe Coping Responses Inventory\u2013Adult Form (CRI\u2010Adult; Moos et\u00a0al.,\n1990\n) measures eight types of coping responses to stressful life events. Eight scales\n               measure cognitive (logical analysis, positive reappraisal, cognitive avoidance, acceptance\n               or resignation) or behavioral coping strategies (seeking guidance and support, problem\n               solving, seeking alternative rewards, emotional discharges), distinguishing approach\n               and avoidance styles. In responding to the CRI\u2010Adult, a subject refers to a recent\n               stressful circumstance, answering on a 4\u2010point rating scale. Two scores (0\u201374) for\n               cognitive and behavioral coping and a total score (0\u2013148) are computed. The higher\n               the score, the more frequent the use of the approach.\nThe World Health Organization QoL scale (WHOQoL 100; WHO,\n1996\n) assesses 25 facets, each including four items. The facets are grouped into seven\n               domains including different facets: Overall QoL (one facet), Physical (pain and discomfort,\n               energy and fatigue, sleep and rest), Psychological (positive feelings, thinking, learning,\n               memory and concentration, self\u2010esteem, body image and appearance, negative feelings),\n               Level of independence (and mobility, activities of daily living, dependence on medication\n               or treatments, work capacity), Social relationships (personal relationships, social\n               support, sexual activity), Environment (physical safety and security, home environment,\n               financial resources, health and social care \u2013 accessibility and quality, opportunities\n               for acquiring new information and skills, participation in and opportunities for recreation/leisure\n               activities, physical environment \u2013 pollution/noise/traffic/climate, transport), and\n               Influence of personal beliefs on life (one facet). Individual items are rated on a\n               5\u2010point Likert scale, where 1 indicates low, negative perceptions and 5 indicates\n               high, positive perceptions. A total score, sum of all item scores, and seven domain\n               scores (the means of the facet scores within the domain multiplied by four, except\n               for the Overall QoL and Influence of beliefs on life domains) are computed. The higher\n               the score, the better the QoL dimension.\nThe Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, total score 0\u201339; Beck et\u00a0al.,\n1996\n) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI 1 and 2; total scores 20\u201380; Spielberger,\n1989\n) assess depression and anxiety. The higher the scores, the worse depression and anxiety.\nData analysis\nFactor analysis of the test scores was used to assess the structure of the neuropsychological\n               battery. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with chronological age, gender, and schooling\n               as covariates (ANCOVA) compared PWE and controls.\nPreliminary Pearson product moment coefficient and regression analyses evaluated the\n               relationship of the FPT scores to the demographic and clinical variables. Partial\n               correlation analyses, with schooling and age of epilepsy onset as covariates, and\n               multiple stepwise regression analyses determined the relationships of the MASQ, CRI\u2010Adult,\n               and WHOQoL 100 scores to the ToM factor. Subsequent partial correlation and regression\n               analyses explored the relationships of the three inventory scores to the FPT scores.\nResults\nCognitive factors\nFactor analysis of the neuropsychological test scores obtained by PWE yielded four\n               factors (ToM, Attention and memory, Lexical search, Set shifting) (Table\n2\n).\nTable 2.\nFactor analysis of the neuropsychological test scores\nTheory of mind\nAttention and memory\nLexical search\nSet shifting\nFPT FP recognition\n0.90\nFPT Question 1\n0.93\nFPT Question 2\n0.88\nFPT Question 3\n0.76\nFPT Question 4\n0.91\nAttentive Matrices\n0.66\nTMT A\n\u22120.70\nTMT B\n\u22120.70\nCorsi Blocks Span\n0.61\nRCPM\n0.54\nShort Story\n0.53\nRCFDR\n0.64\nWFT on phonemic cue\n0.89\nWFT on semantic cue\n0.79\nDigit Span\n0.74\nWeigl Sorting Test\n0.72\nFPT No\u2010FP exclusion\n0.70\nExplained variance Total\u00a0=\u00a068.44%\n25.39%\n19.57%\n15.21%\n8.27%\nFPT, Faux Pas Task; FP, faux pas; TMT, Trail Making Test; RCPM, Raven Colored Progressive\n                        Matrices; RCFDR, Rey Complex Figure Delayed Recall; WFT, Word Fluency Test.\nComparisons between PWE and controls\nTables\n3\nand\n4\nsummarize the test and inventory scores.

Two separate regression analyses entering the cognitive factors, BDI, and\n               STAI scores revealed that the CRI\u2010Adult cognitive score was predicted by the Lexical\n               search factor (R\n2\n=\u00a00.16, F\u00a0=\u00a09.12, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and BDI scores (R\n2\n=\u00a00.24, F\u00a0=\u00a07.57, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), whereas the CRI\u2010Adult total score was predicted by\n               the ToM factor score (R\n2\n=\u00a00.16, F\u00a0=\u00a09.18, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Regression analysis of the CRI\u2010Adult behavioral score\n               entering the cognitive factors, BDI and STAI scores, and chronological age revealed\n               an influence for the ToM factor (R\n2\n=\u00a00.15, F\u00a0=\u00a09.03, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and chronological age (R\n2\n=\u00a00.28, F\u00a0=\u00a09.09, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nWhen considering the FPT scores, the CRI\u2010Adult cognitive score was predicted by the\n               second comprehension and FP recognition scores, the behavioral score by the second\n               comprehension score, and the total score by the second comprehension score (Table\n5\n).\nRelationships between ToM and QoL\nThe WHOQoL 100 Overall (r\u00a0=\u00a00.29, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), Level of independence (r\u00a0=\u00a00.25, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04),\n               and Environment domain scores (r\u00a0=\u00a00.29, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) correlated with the ToM factor\n               score, whereas none of the QoL domain scores correlated with the Attention and memory,\n               Lexical search, or Set shifting factor scores.

Regression analyses adding the BDI and STAI scores revealed\n               that the WHOQoL 100 total score (R\n2\n=\u00a00.38, F\u00a0=\u00a039.07, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the Overall (R\n2\n=\u00a00.33, F\u00a0=\u00a033.03, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Level of independence (R\n2\n=\u00a00.30, F\u00a0=\u00a027.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Influence of personal beliefs on life (R\n2\n=\u00a00.30, F\u00a0=\u00a026.99, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Physical (R\n2\n=\u00a00.24, F\u00a0=\u00a022.97, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Psychological (R\n2\n=\u00a00.53, F = 73.15, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Social (R\n2\n=\u00a00.22, F\u00a0=\u00a017.82, p < 0.001), and Environment domain scores (R\n2\n=\u00a00.35, F\u00a0=\u00a034.95, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were predicted by the STAI2 score. The Level of independence\n               domain score also related to the BDI scores (R\n2\n=\u00a00.35, F\u00a0=\u00a017.28, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), whereas the Overall domain score showed mild correlations\n               with the ToM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.053) and Attention and memory factor scores (r\u00a0=\u00a00.24,\n               p\u00a0=\u00a00.057).\nIn 51 PWE, cumulative regression analyses entering the cognitive factors, BDI, STAI,\n               MASQ, and CRI\u2010Adult scores, showed that the Overall domain score was predicted by\n               the STAI2 (R\n2\n=\u00a00.40, F\u00a0=\u00a032.84, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and ToM factor scores (R\n2\n=\u00a00.49, F\u00a0=\u00a024.41, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nWhen considering the FPT scores, the WHOQoL 100 total score and the Level of Independence\n               domain score were predicted by the second and first comprehension scores; the Overall\n               domain score by the second comprehension score; and the Physical, Psychological, and\n               Environment domain scores by the third comprehension score (Table\n5\n).\nDiscussion\nThis study evaluated the relationships of ToM to self\u2010appraisal, coping, and QoL in\n            patients with focal epilepsy with the goal of clarifying the clinical significance\n            of ToM impairment. ToM deficits proved to predict self\u2010rated cognitive functioning,\n            coping strategies to stressful events, and Overall QoL perception. To our knowledge,\n            this is the first study assessing such aspects in epilepsy, providing evidence that\n            ToM may have psychobehavioral implications.\nThe preliminary results of the study (as revealed by comparisons between PWE and healthy\n            subjects and factor analysis) maintained the following: (1) focal epilepsy originating\n            from the temporal or frontal lobe can impair ToM and (2) ToM deficits represent a\n            specific pattern distinct from other cognitive deficits (Farrant et\u00a0al.,\n2005\n; Schacher et\u00a0al.,\n2006\n; Giovagnoli et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n). The results also confirmed that, although the FPT scores correlated with education,\n            age of seizure onset, and disease duration, age of seizure onset only predicted ToM\n            performance, explaining 8% of its variance (Giovagnoli et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n).\nA new result was that the capacity to recognize and comprehend real mental states\n            and interpersonal interactions may contribute to explain the variance of cognitive\n            self\u2010rating, suggesting that ToM adequacy is important to a correct estimation of\n            one's own functioning. A crucial component of ToM is the comprehension that minds\n            can take different perspectives on the world. Correct solution of ToM tasks requires\n            to distinguish between mental representations held by the self and by the others (Brass\n            et\u00a0al.,\n2009\n). Although the FPT does not directly assess the comprehension of one's own mental\n            states, it requires a subject to separate the facts described to them from the mental\n            states they attribute to the characters and their own point of view. Therefore, a\n            subject who understands real mental states, maintaining a proper self\u2010versus\u2010other\n            distinction, should also maintain self\u2010awareness including a congruent appreciation\n            of their cognitive functioning. In line with previous studies, self\u2010rated cognitive\n            functioning also related to the level of state anxiety (Giovagnoli et\u00a0al.,\n1997\n; Sawrie et\u00a0al.,\n1999\n; Ba\u00f1os et\u00a0al.,\n2004\n; Giovagnoli,\n2012\n) and the Attention and memory factor (Seidenberg et\u00a0al.,\n1994\n; Giovagnoli,\n2012\n).\nIn 51 of 66 PWE, ToM contributed to predict coping. The ToM factor explained 16% of\n            the variance of the CRI\u2010Adult total score and 15% of the variance of the CRI\u2010Adult\n            behavioral score, although the latter was also determined by chronological age (13%).\n            The CRI\u2010Adult cognitive score was predicted by the Lexical search factor and BDI scores.\n            When considering distinct FPT performances, the CRI\u2010Adult total, behavioral, and cognitive\n            scores related to the second comprehension score, which explained 10\u201315% of their\n            variance, and the cognitive score was also associated with the FP recognition score\n            (10%). This suggests that, in PWE, the understanding of others' mental states may\n            contribute to adaptation, thereby influencing coping strategies. In this regard, the\n            comprehension of real mental states and social interactions (as expressed by the second\n            comprehension score) appears the most relevant ToM performance. A well\u2010preserved capacity\n            to appreciate interpersonal communication and relational dynamics in a small social\n            group may be important to analyze stressful or sudden circumstances and to solve new\n            problems. Therefore, understanding other's thoughts and relations could help find\n            adequate cognitive or behavioral strategies to face personal and interpersonal stressors.\n            It is worth noting that the CRI\u2010Adult cognitive score was predicted by the Lexical\n            search factor and BDI scores, suggesting that well\u2010preserved strategic search and\n            language, together with adequate mood, are important to the choice of coping solutions.\nThe ToM factor, in particular the ability to comprehend others' mental states and\n            interactions, contributed in predicting the Overall QoL perception. Although circumscribed,\n            this relation indicates a positive influence for mind reading on subjective well\u2010being.\n            The more efficient the understanding of others' minds and interactions, the better\n            the perception of QoL. An adequate comprehension of real mental states and interpersonal\n            dynamics could avoid redundant thoughts or actions, helping make behavior fluid, or\n            enhancing the feelings of belonging to a social group. A negative influence of ToM\n            impairment on QoL parallels the effects of poor mood, stigma, and low\u2010self\u2010esteem\n            on personal well\u2010being and social integration (Gramstad et\u00a0al.,\n2001\n; Suurmeijer et\u00a0al.,\n2001\n; Giovagnoli et\u00a0al.,\n2006\n). In line with the previous studies, QoL primarily related to anxiety and depression\n            (Fisher et\u00a0al.,\n2000\n; Hermann et\u00a0al.,\n2000\n; Gramstad et\u00a0al.,\n2001\n; Suurmeijer et\u00a0al.,\n2001\n; Giovagnoli et\u00a0al.,\n2006\n; Tracy et\u00a0al.,\n2007\n; Gois et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n).\nTogether, these findings resemble the results of previous studies of frontotemporal\n            dementia, where ToM deficits related to psychobehavioral alterations, as expressed\n            by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Gregory et\u00a0al.,\n2002\n), obsessive\u2010compulsive disorders (Grisham et\u00a0al.,\n2010\n), schizophrenia (Koelkebeck et\u00a0al.,\n2010\n), or schizophrenia\u2010related social maladjustment (Mehl et\u00a0al.,\n2010\n), supporting the clinical significance of ToM impairment. The present findings may\n            contribute to clarification of the psychosocial maladjustment caused by epilepsy (Hermann\n            et\u00a0al.,\n2000\n; Reynders et\u00a0al.,\n2005\n; Gois et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n; Broicher et\u00a0al.,\n2012\n). In keeping with Broicher et\u00a0al. (\n2012\n), these results demonstrated no association between ToM and depression, maintaining\n            that high\u2010order cognitive abilities and mood are distinct aspects. On the contrary,\n            the discrepancy in the relationship between ToM and QoL (not documented by Broicher\n            et\u00a0al.,\n2012\n) may reflect differences in QoL measurement. The QOLIE 30 (Vickrey et\u00a0al.,\n1993\n) used by Broicher et\u00a0al. (\n2012\n) is an epilepsy\u2010specific inventory, whereas the WHOQoL 100 is a generic measurement.\n            The WHOQoL 100, validated in a large population with a variety of health states, provides\n            transversal non\u2013disease\u2010related information (WHO,\n1996\n). Compared with disease\u2010specific inventories, it may give more information on psychobehavioral\n            aspects, allowing more precise comparisons between QoL and ToM.\nIn patients with TLE, Reynders et\u00a0al. (\n2005\n) found no relationship between the judgment of social trustworthiness and psychobehavioral\n            distress, but they did not assess ToM. In other patients with TLE, Gois et\u00a0al. (\n2011\n) showed that social adjustment was influenced by attention and memory, whereas in\n            patients with idiopathic epilepsy, Shehata et\u00a0al. (\n2009\n) revealed that aggressive behavior and psychotic personality traits correlated with\n            comprehension and memory performances. The present study extends such findings, demonstrating\n            that, in patients with focal epilepsy, ToM may explain some psychobehavioral alterations\n            more consistently than other cognitive functions. The association between ToM and\n            psychobehavioral alterations may reflect damage to common neural substrates that underlie\n            ToM and emotional\u2010behavioral control (Shamay\u2010Premack & Woodroof, 1978; Baron\u2010Cohen\n            et\u00a0al.,\n1994\n; Stone et\u00a0al.,\n1998\n; Shamay\u2010Tsoory & Aharon\u2010Peretz,\n2007\n). Neural activity supported by the medial temporal and prefrontal cortical areas\n            and their connecting pathways can be damaged by TLE and FLE, explaining a coexistence\n            of ToM impairment and psychobehavioral alterations (Schacher et\u00a0al.,\n2006\n; Giovagnoli et\u00a0al.,\n2011\n).\nTo conclude, selective ToM deficits provoked by focal epilepsy may have a clinical\n            impact, with particular effects on self\u2010appraisal, coping, and overall QoL perception.\n            Further studies are needed to confirm these results. Clarifying ToM alterations may\n            help plan nonpharmacologic treatment, such as cognitive training, metacognitive therapy,\n            psychotherapy, or work/social training. Cross\u2010cultural comparisons between neuropsychological\n            and psychobehavioral assessment used in different epilepsy clinics may validate any\n            result.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Serena Oliveri, Anna Tarallo, and Valentina Manfredi for helping\n            with the neuropsychological tests, Chiara Paterlini for scoring the WHOQoL 100 and\n            CRI\u2010Adult inventories, and all of the patients for collaborating to the study.\nDisclosure\nThe authors declare no conflict of interests.

Over the latter half of the 20th century, QoL models have\n            proliferated, particularly in relation to the population with intellectual disabilities\n            (ID) which have arguably improved living conditions and helped to guard against abuse.\n            While this is a complex phenomenon, there is agreement across a wide literature that\n            QoL has two distinct aspects relating to the individual (whether disabled or not)\n            and the resources necessary for a \u201cgood\u201d QoL. Considerable support is also provided\n            for a number of diverse but robust domains. However, how the \u201cnature\u201d of QoL is conceptualized\n            is unclear. The article reviews multidisciplinary research on QoL and goes on to present\n            a theoretical model of the nature of QoL that encompasses identified domains. The\n            model is based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs (1987) which defines its scope; Sen's\n            Capability Approach (1985), which elaborates the resource context impacting QoL; and\n            Ryan and Deci's Self\u2010Determination Theory (2000), which describes person\u2010context interactions\n            important to personally valued QoL. This conceptualization was framed within four\n            facets\u2014Foundational well\u2010being; Psychosocial well\u2010being; Status; and Autonomy\u2014each\n            of which have two aspects: \u201cindividual,\u201d describing personal needs that, when fulfilled,\n            are associated with better QoL, and \u201ccontext,\u201d describing resources necessary to enable\n            individual need fulfilment. The proposed QoL model demonstrates an intellectually\n            lucid structure supported by literature. It does not attempt a definitive specification\n            of all QoL constituents but proposes that delineation must be determined within the\n            particular circumstances of a proposed assessment. Once determined, an exploratory\n            approach to assessment is proposed. It is suggested this model represents a useful\n            \u201catlas\u201d on the nature of QoL to guide development of assessments aiming to inform\n            service developments or interventions.\nIntroduction\nThe term \u201cquality of life\u201d (QoL) is so widely used as to have arguably lost any meaningful\n            value. As much as a \u201cgood\u201d QoL is aspired to, and a topic of serious study within\n            the social sciences, the term is also clearly used and abused within marketing or\n            political campaigns in efforts to persuade. On one hand, a political party will portray\n            itself as the true champion of the nation and clear in its vision of how the population\n            is to achieve the \u201cgood life.\u201d While on the other, commercial interests suggest that\n            no one has the ultimate in QoL without a particular car, sofa, or soft drink. Alongside\n            such pronouncements, the term is used more functionally and expressed through statistics\n            describing national progress toward (un)specified goals representing citizens\u2019 QoL.\n            So what are we actually referring to when we use the term?\nIt is generally recognized that the field of \u201cQoL\u201d is highly complex. It is not possible\n            to access the full range of literature on the topic, particularly within the confines\n            of a single article. However, within these limits, development of QoL models will\n            be briefly examined, alongside psychological and sociological understandings of its\n            character and influences. A model using the work of Abraham Maslow on motivation and\n            personality (Maslow,\n1987\n), will be proposed. This framework comprises \u201cfacets\u201d of QoL within which individual\n            and contextual aspects influencing QoL will be outlined, drawing on the work of Amartya\n            Sen (\n1985\n). The place of the person within the model will be discussed, reflecting on theories\n            of self\u2010determination (Deci & Ryan,\n1985\n; Ryan & Deci,\n2000\n).\nIn conceptualizing individual QoL, there appears no sound argument for defining different\n            theoretical models for different populations. People with intellectual disabilities\n            (ID), for instance, should be entitled to expect a valued QoL of the same scope as\n            any other member of society. What will occasion particular consideration for this\n            population is the impact of their disability across different aspects of their life\n            and availability of concomitant contextual resources. Similarly, a QoL conceptualization\n            should apply across the full age range from babies and small children, to older people\n            and frail elderly. In this case, developmental stage will influence QoL such that\n            different elements may have greater or less salience at different life stages. However,\n            the underlying concept should arguably remain constant. The model outlined here therefore\n            is not targeted on \u201cadults\u201d or people with ID but on \u201cpeople\u201d in general.\nThe very wide literature on the topic clearly demonstrates that conceptualization\n            of QoL must be a multidisciplinary effort. This is appropriate as interest in factors\n            impacting human existence and experience extend through multiple and overlapping lay,\n            academic and professional spheres. Of all literatures, that relating to people with\n            ID appears among the most multidisciplinary in character. It has been prompted, however,\n            by real concerns over discrimination against, and poor treatment of this population,\n            and a desire to improve the life experience of this group. Unsurprisingly, therefore,\n            in recent years this sphere has made considerable progress into \u201cwhat\u201d characterises\n            individual \u201cQoL,\u201d while earlier researchers investigated the nature of QoL itself.\n            Hence this is an important literature informing the conceptualization presented here.\nThe author's background is in ID research but using a psychological lens prompting\n            particular concern with \u201cQoL\u201d as experienced by individuals. While psychology has\n            a long tradition of positivism, the author adopts a critical realist worldview in\n            which the existence of an underlying reality, or \u201ctruth\u201d is recognized, but it is\n            acknowledged that our attempts to know and understand that reality is constructed\n            from the labels we bestow derived from our own perceptions and experience. As such,\n            these understandings are open to further investigation, discovery and change (Bryman,\n2012\n). From this viewpoint, arguably, the \u201ctrue\u201d QoL of an individual can\nonly\nbe ascertained by the person concerned, because only they, with their multitudinous\n            characteristics, experiences, and ambitions, can make such a personal judgement. However,\n            in terms of facilitating attainment of a personally defined \u201cgood\u201d QoL, local and\n            national governments require evidence on which to base their policy decisions, to\n            the benefit of their citizens and nation. They are responsible for provision of a\n            fertile, resource, and opportunity rich environment within which individuals have\n            opportunities to achieve a \u201cgood\u201d QoL. It would be counterproductive, therefore, to\n            present an entirely \u201cpsychological take\u201d on this topic. Instead, concepts and constructs\n            from the wider, as well as individual\u2010focused literatures on QoL will be synthesized.\n            However, as a first step, clarification of how the \u201chuman individual\u201d is conceived\n            within this article is required.\nHuman beings are complex; they are greater than the sum of their biopsychosocial attributes.\n            In this article, it is suggested that the \u201chuman individual\u201d is characterized by biopsycho\n            determinants that are unique to them, but that the interaction between these and their\n            social environment determines their cultural growth and values as a member of a particular\n            \u201csociety.\u201d Further, their perceptions, priorities, and potential is, in turn, also\n            influenced and impacted by the nonhuman environment. This composition of self\u2014society\u2014place\n            is proposed to determine individuals\u2019 perceptions, thoughts and preferences regarding\n            their life choices and ultimately their \u201cQoL.\u201d A valued, \u201cgood\u201d QoL is therefore manifest\n            by an individual's positive ratings (consciously or unconsciously) of themself, their\n            relationships with other people, and their wider environmental context.\nDo We Need a New Model of QoL?\nThis article was prompted by recognition that promotion of QoL for individuals requires\n               a clear conceptualization of its nature. There have been many discussions and proposed\n               models of QoL, with considerable effort on conceptualization being spent over the\n               past 20\u201330 years on devising measures that might be used to support improvements in\n               people's lives. However, there was little focus on theory to illuminate how decisions\n               on \u201cwhat\u201d to measure had been made. It appears timely, therefore, to review developments\n               in QoL from a number of disciplines. In gaining an understanding of these perspectives,\n               the need for a new theoretical model of QoL arguably becomes clearer.\nPart 1: Background\nThe Development of QoL Models\nThe literature illustrates that measurement of QoL has been pursued in the context\n               of individuals, communities, and/or nations (e.g., Brauer & Dymitrow,\n2014\n; Brown, Hatton, & Emerson,\n2013\n; Diener,\n1995\n). While conjecture on the nature of QoL has been a subject from the time of Aristotle,\n               debate in the 20th century began to feed into national agendas and policy. Models\n               of QoL were proposed from a range of disciplines, with some of the most active researchers\n               being concerned with social policy. Below, key developments are reviewed that are\n               representative of a wide ranging research activity on the topic.\nAndrews and Withey (\n1976\n) noted the emergence of the term \u201cQoL\u201d at a time in the 1960s when it became apparent\n               that indicators were signaling improvement in living conditions, but certain populations\n               were manifesting discontent. Building on existing work on \u201csocial indicators,\u201d concerned\n               with economic and social measurement of national progress, they promoted consideration\n               of subjective judgements alongside objective measurement, which they saw as interrelated.\n               They identified \u201clife concerns\u201d derived from research into issues people considered\n               of significant concern to them, and used this knowledge to develop \u201cSocial Indicators\n               of Well\u2010being.\u201d These included both global (How do you feel about your life as a whole?)\n               and specific indicators (housing, employment, and family life) to provide general\n               evaluations of \u201clife concerns\u201d (Andrews & Withey,\n1976\n). They suggested there should be no limit to the number of \u201csets\u201d of indicators that\n               could be established.\nQoL was therefore represented both by a comprehensive system of indicators, designed\n               to encompass main aspects of the phenomenon, and by a global indicator thought to\n               reveal its general character. Kiuranov (1980) argued comprehensive systems recognize\n               the complexity of QoL but ultimately must be reduced to a \u201cfunctional mainstay\u201d to\n               represent it, and that this is difficult to detail. Accordingly, Kiuranov (1980) argued\n               for a single concept of QoL and hence single \u201cintegral indicator\u201d but did not elaborate\n               this \u201cconcept.\u201d His own solution focused solely on contentment with working life.\n               His fundamental argument was that while a \u201csimple\u201d solution is limited, it is attractive\n               because of the difficulties in adequately outlining a comprehensive model of QoL.\n               However, this type of single generic measure appears satisfactory only if our solitary\n               goal is to establish whether people feel their lives are OK, or better than they were.\n               This may be sufficient where our concern is national trends, but would not enable\n               us to identify where a person, or their community/environment, needs support or intervention\n               to improve their subjective and/or objective QoL.\nAcknowledging the importance of the subjective view, \u201cpsychological indicators\u201d were\n               routinely employed in models of QoL. Identified life domains, associated with \u201cpsychological\n               well\u2010being,\u201d included physical and material well\u2010being; relations with other people;\n               social, community, and civic activities; personal development and fulfilment; and\n               recreation (Flanagan,\n1982\n). \u201cSatisfaction with life\u201d domains included marriage and family life, health, standard\n               of living, and amount of education (Campbell, Converse, & Rodgers,\n1976\n). However, it was recognized that assessment of perceptions may represent what the\n               person thought the researcher wanted to hear, and that while \u201csatisfied,\u201d the person's\n               external reality might be unacceptable from an objective QoL perspective and so this\n               must still be accounted for (Zautra & Goodhart,\n1979\n).\nThe \u201cgoodness\u2010of\u2010fit,\u201d or social policy approach within the ID research community,\n               attempted to address this issue by identifying unmet needs, which were then weighted\n               by importance and allocated resources on this basis. This type of QoL assessment compared\n               the person's needs with their environmental resources, to determine the gap between\n               them. \u201cHigher\u201d QoL was represented by a good fit between needs and resources (Murrell\n               and Norris, 1983, cited by Day & Jankey,\n1996\n).\nThe social policy approach to QoL was also adopted as a way to implement policy aspirations\n               in practice. These models focused on outcomes associated with \u201ccommunity adaptation\u201d\n               thought to represent a better QoL (Schalock,\n1990a\n). Here, domains related to social policy goals on Independence (living environment),\n               Interpersonal and community relationships, and Productivity. Schalock and Thornton\n               (\n1988\n) proposed a model directly reflecting this agenda. Where levels of the model reflected\n               goals of Independence, Productivity, or Community integration linked to \u201cHome,\u201d \u201cJob,\u201d\n               and \u201cCommunity (recreation/leisure)\u201d contexts (Schalock,\n1990b\n, Fig 14.1, p. 146). Focus on these target variables aimed to yield person centered\n               outcomes in each context, and were proposed to represent enhanced (or opportunities\n               to enhance) QoL.\nSocial policy also drove Goode's (\n1990\n) development of a \u201cClient\u2010Driven, Ecological, QOL Model.\u201d This model put the perception\n               of the individual at its core. That is, a need/environmental resource contrast was\n               made alongside contrasts between a person's abilities and perceived environmental\n               demands upon them. The interactions between these elements, and additional external\n               elements (impacting the person's perceptions) and life events out of the person's\n               control, were taken into account. These were thought to impact \u201clife setting\u201d satisfaction\n               level and thereby their overall QoL. Goode stated that where these are satisfactory\n               to both the person with disability and significant others in the setting, then this\n               is conducive to experiencing a better QoL. As with the Schalock and Thornton (\n1988\n) model, the social policy remit meant this model was devised with people with disabilities\n               in mind and not all \u201chuman individuals.\u201d Goode's model's \u201csetting\u2010related\u201d view of\n               QoL arguably limits its scope further. While it may be pertinent to address specific\n               setting\u2010related QoL issues for a person, it is suggested here that this needs to be\n               explored within a holistic concept of what comprises QoL. Tying QoL to policy goals\n               arguably narrows the aspiration of the concept.\nEthnographer Robert Edgerton (\n1990\n) criticized the proclivities of social scientists toward compiling sets of standards\n               and creating \u201csimple\u201d measures to establish a person's current status. While acknowledging\n               these may help guard against abuse and neglect of people with ID, he was uncomfortable\n               that individual choice might be replaced with a \u201cQoL Quotient.\u201d He suggested establishing\n               domains of QoL, to be reached to acceptable standards, may be a \u201charmless\u201d expression\n               of values, but could \u201ccreate frustratingly unattainable expectations\u201d (Edgerton,\n1990\n, p. 150). This is a serious point. It would not profit anyone to add to the daily\n               trials and anxieties of individuals with ID. However, how do such sentiments sit alongside\n               a person's right to \u201caspire,\u201d to have dreams of \u201cwhat might be?\u201d\nEdgerton champions individual choice and the notion that people with ID should determine\n               the life they wish to lead. In reflection on his own, and others\u2019 longitudinal research\n               on \u201clife satisfaction\u201d he noted some individuals retain a positive and optimistic\n               outlook despite life events that may trouble them greatly for a time. Similarly he\n               noted those tending to a negative and pessimistic outlook remained pessimistic despite\n               the short\u2010term impact of positive life events. Edgerton (\n1990\n) commented that this appeared to relate to their \u201cinternal dispositions\u201d (p. 156)\n               and was not an ongoing reaction to environmental factors. He concluded that a person's\n               subjective sense of well\u2010being may derive more from internal characteristics such\n               as personality or temperament than from features of their environment, but supported\n               the notion that \u201cwell\u2010being\u201d is setting\u2010specific, such that occupational \u201cwell\u2010being\u201d\n               can be different to residential \u201cwell\u2010being.\u201d\nThe early social indicator QoL model literature reflects a great deal of work on addressing\n               concerns voiced by the population but does not establish an underlying QoL concept.\n               Social policy approaches appear limited in scope, or too context specific. There the\n               ambition appeared to be assessment of social policy goals rather than providing conceptualization\n               of QoL to support a range of uses. However, important individual perspectives on QoL\n               were accessed alongside objective measurements. Longitudinal ethnographic work advised\n               caution in indiscriminate application of \u201cstandardized values\u201d to people with ID and\n               suggested that an individual's personal characteristics seemed to have a significant\n               impact on how they evaluated their QoL.\nThe issue of subjective evaluation in assessment has been subject to criticism. Day\n               and Jankey (\n1996\n) noted measurement of subjective elements of QoL were often on researcher imposed\n               domains and risked omitting elements important to the individual. Consequently, they\n               suggested that the person should define the terms by which their lives should be evaluated,\n               and should conduct that evaluation. However, investigation of this approach by Day,\n               Jankey, Alon, Clingbine, and Reznick (1993, cited by Day & Jankey,\n1996\n) found that even within one subgroup of participants (people with disabilities, chronic\n               health problems, or no problems), definitions of QoL were very different. Further,\n               no between group comparisons could be made. In response, a simple \u201coverarching model\u201d\n               of higher order factors was established describing \u201chow\u201d evaluation of QoL was achieved\n               rather than \u201cwhat\u201d QoL looked like for individuals or groups (Day & Jankey,\n1996\n, pp. 47\u201349).\nBuilding on earlier models of QoL and associated ID literature, Renwick and Brown\n               (\n1996\n) proposed a model recognizing that people have physical, psychological, and spiritual\n               dimensions, and an innate need to \u201cbelong\u201d to communities in physical and social senses.\n               They also suggested individuals need to pursue their own goals, and make their own\n               decisions and choices as unique human beings. This was a significant move toward a\n               more holistic conceptualization of the nature of life quality.\nRenwick and Brown's (\n1996\n) \u201cCentre for Health Promotion\u201d (CHP) model of QoL was conceived as equally applicable\n               to people with and without disabilities; as multidimensional, dynamic and evolving;\n               and arising from ongoing interaction with the environment. While they viewed the perspective\n               of the person as most important in understanding their QoL they noted the \u201cmacro environment,\u201d\n               in which opportunities and constraints to choice operate, is also influential but\n               that the importance the person attaches to each affects its impact.\nThe CHP QoL Model included three major components, Being, Belonging and Becoming.\n               \u201c\nBeing\n\u201d comprised physical health status (e.g., health, nutrition, and fitness), psychological\n               well\u2010being (e.g., feelings and self\u2010evaluations such as self\u2010confidence) and spiritual\n               beliefs and values (e.g., religiosity or intangible experiences related to music or\n               other arts); \u201c\nBelonging\n\u201d comprised physical environment context (e.g., privacy and safety), social environment\n               (e.g., meaningful relationships with family and social contacts) and community resources\n               (e.g., access to employment, education, and other services); and \u201c\nBecoming\n\u201d comprised practical activities (e.g., studying, housework, and self\u2010care), leisure\n               activities (to promote relaxation, or work\u2010life balance), and growth activities promoting\n               development of skills and knowledge\u2014formally or informally.\nRenwick and Brown (\n1996\n) proposed that importance and enjoyment of aspects of QoL are determinants moderated\n               (increased or decreased) by\ncontrol\n(i.e., perception of the degree of control over important possibilities); and\npotential opportunities\n(perceptions of potential\u2014current and likely\u2014opportunities). The model recognized\n               the need to consider wider contextual factors alongside the individual's well\u2010being\n               needs. While contextual and individual factors are included within the three components\n               (Being Belonging Becoming) of the CHP QoL Model, the individual/context interrelationship\n               arguably requires further elaboration and explanation. Moreover, Day and Jankey's\n               (\n1996\n) conclusion, that factors of importance to individuals need to inform QoL definition\n               (Day et al., 1983, cited by Day and Jankey,\n1996\n), needs to be addressed. The Day and Jankey (\n1996\n) proposal, however, does not clarify whether individuals were guided in their consideration\n               of possible dimensions of QoL that \u201cmight\u201d be reflected upon in deciding \u201cwhat\u201d is\n               important.\nPsychological Influences on QoL Evaluation\nEdgerton's ethnographic work pointed to issues of \u201ctemperament\u201d that may impact on\n               personal evaluation of QoL and, indeed, psychologists have also been concerned to\n               establish personal factors that characterize, or impact, QoL. Much of this work refers\n               to \u201csubjective well\u2010being (SWB),\u201d clearly taking a person\u2010centric view of QoL and\n               arguably lacking attention to wider context. Stones and Shye (\n2014\n) present strong evidence in support of the fundamental role of individual characteristics\n               in perceptions of QoL, or \u201cSWB.\u201d Evidence from twin studies comparing SWB assessment\n               scores against other measures, for pairs of monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic\n               (nonidentical) twins, revealed a strong relationship between genetic make\u2010up and SWB\n               scores (e.g., Stones, Kozma, McNeil, & Worobtz,\n2011\n). This and other evidence strongly suggested a genetic component that mediates\nsome\naspects of QoL/SWB (e.g., Schnittker,\n2008\n). For example, genetic influence was demonstrated to relate more clearly to a tendency\n               to evaluate life issues in particular ways over the long term, rather than in the\n               short term or for specific events (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith,\n1999\n). There is also general agreement that a genetic component underlies individual personality\n               traits, and these impact perceptions of, hence differences in SWB/QoL (Schnittker,\n2008\n; Weiss, Bates, & Luciano,\n2008\n).\nTemperament is an \u201cumbrella\u201d term reflecting a number of innate aspects of personality,\n               such as extraversion (Stones & Shye,\n2014\n). It develops in response to these internal characteristics and socialization, and\n               is associated with \u201cdisposition\u201d (tendency to act in particular ways). Both temperament\n               and disposition have been used as explanatory factors for perceived QoL. As noted\n               above, for example, Edgerton's (\n1990\n) longitudinal research indicated that some individuals would \u201cbounce back\u201d from adverse\n               events after a period of time, to assume their usual sense of possessing a good QoL,\n               while good fortune did not permanently reverse a sense of poor QoL for others (e.g.,\n               Ormel,\n1983\n). Differences in temperament are said to account for differences in perceptions of\n               QoL between people in similar contexts.\n\u201cPersonality\u201d (including temperament), has been defined as comprising the \u201c\nmore or less stable, internal factors that make one person's behaviour consistent\n                  from one time to another, and different from the behaviour other people would manifest\n                  in comparable situations\n.\u201d (Child, 1968, p. 83, cited by Eysenck,\n2000\np. 744). Weiss et al. (\n2008\n), among others, have noted a \u201cgeneral factor of personality\u201d that reflected differences\n               in scores on a life satisfaction scale (Musek,\n2007\n). They report \u201cevaluative cognitions\u201d (processes involved in subjective evaluation)\n               research suggests that different measures of well\u2010being, regardless of content, tend\n               to \u201cco\u2010vary.\u201d That is, a person who scores highly on one measure will also tend to\n               have high scores on other measures of well\u2010being.\nThe literature discussed above suggests that despite changes in the way we act or\n               experience life, there is some consistent thread of \u201cself\u201d running throughout. This\n               notion reflects Antonovsky's (\n1987\n) concept \u201cSense of Coherence\u201d (SoC), said to be key to the theory of salutogenesis\n               (meaning origins of health) (Langeland,\n2014\n). SoC is said to be a dynamic, enduring, and pervasive confidence of the part of\n               the individual that their internal and external environments in life are\ncomprehensible\n(i.e., structured, predictable, and explicable),\nmanageable\n(i.e., they have resources to meet \u201cenvironmental\u201d demands), and\nmeaningful\n(i.e., they are of interest to the person and are worth engaging in), (Antonovsky,\n1987\n). Resonant with the CHP QoL model (Renwick & Brown,\n1996\n), individuals are characterized as biopsychosocial beings who are also spiritual.\n               They are seen as actively involved in seeking health and \u201cself\u2010actualization,\u201d through\n               being proactive and reactive, and making choices to determine their own path\u2014a factor\n               highlighted by Bach and Rioux (\n1996\n). Antonovsky (\n1987\n) saw SoC as a stable attribute once a person reaches maturity. However, it is now\n               suggested that SoC may be improved through appropriate interventions (Langeland,\n2014\n).\nRelated to this notion that personality/temperament is \u201cmore or less stable\u201d are a\n               series of studies that have suggested changes in conditions can cause temporary changes\n               in perceived QoL/SWB but that persons adapt (habituate) to the change and ultimately\n               revert to their constitutional disposition (\u201cSet Point Theory\u201d) (Lykken & Tellegen,\n1996\n). This was confirmed by Easterlin (1974, cited by Headey,\n2014\n) in relation to the economic domain of life, where greater wealth provided only temporary\n               improvements in SWB. However, some fundamental life events, or changes in family circumstance\n               or health, do appear to cause permanent changes in SWB (Easterlin,\n2005\n). Headey (\n2014\n) concludes that individual and contextual factors both account for differences in\n               SWB. He argued that individual factors, out of the person's control (e.g., personality\n               traits and genes), may account for the relative stability seen in SWB ratings, while\n               contextual factors such as objective conditions, and individuals\u2019 preferences and\n               choices influenced by mood, may account for short\u2010term changes in SWB.\nDay and Jankey's (\n1996\n) review of psychological literature also demonstrated links between QoL and self\u2010esteem,\n               optimism, sociability, and SoC (Kozma and Stones, 1978; Scheier and Carver, 1985;\n               Emmons and Diener, 1985; Jankey, 1992, respectively, all cited by Day & Jankey,\n1996\n). However, they noted a dearth of qualitative studies to explain the meanings behind\n               satisfaction ratings, and variations in mood and other factors, that impact quantitative\n               measures.\nThese literatures lend support to the notion of a psychological/individualistic aspect\n               that must be accounted for in elaborating a model of QoL. Research on psychological\n               and physical factors that influence SWB, and/or its evaluation has produced strong\n               evidence that individual characteristics account for different evaluations of well\u2010being\n               in similar circumstances, and that a personally constructed model of QoL is \u201cidiosyncratic.\u201d\n               Overall, psychological and social science accounts appear congruent, although they\n               emphasize different but related aspects of QoL. The difficulty arises in attempts\n               to draft an \u201cexact\u201d specification for a \u201cdefinitive\u201d model (Kiuranov,\n1980\n).\nThe Place of \u201cthe Person\u201d within QoL Models\nThe discussion above illustrates that characteristics of the individual are highly\n               likely to influence their subjective evaluation of their QoL. The place of the person,\n               therefore, within any QoL model is significant but often only referred to obliquely.\n               Pertinent here are issues of choice and control, and the higher order factor, self\u2010determination,\n               which are referred to in the QoL literature. Bach and Rioux (1996) discuss the importance\n               of \u201cself\u2010determination,\u201d not to determine the character of QoL evaluation for individuals\n               as Day and Jankey (\n1996\n) had proposed, but for personal goal setting. Wehmeyer and Abery (\n2013\n) have emphasized the importance of self\u2010determination in enabling people with ID\n               to achieve a valued QoL. For example, Wehmeyer and Schwartz (\n1998\n) found higher ratings of self\u2010determination were associated with better ratings of\n               QoL among adults with ID. They found QoL ratings negatively impacted where choice\n               and control restrictions were imposed in settings. Bach and Rioux (1996) agree self\u2010determination\n               is achieved in the context of \u201cfreedom from\u201d constraints imposed by others, but also\n               \u201cfreedom to\u201d follow their needs or aspirations. They argue that governments have a\n               role in restricting freedoms, where this is legitimate, but also to provide the conditions\n               necessary for individuals to act on their freedom to pursue needs or aspirations.\n               This has implications for states which may need to enact laws (such as the UK Equality\n               Act\n2010\n) to remove barriers to participation in, or use of community or national facilities\n               or resources, and so is an important contextual element of any QoL model.\nMichalos (\n2014\n) extended this analysis of the \u201cplace of the person,\u201d pointing out that QoL is not\n               only defined by what the person thinks and feels about their circumstances, but what\n               they do about that evaluation, and the consequences of those actions. That is, a person's\n               perceptions can impact both their own and other's living conditions and thus they\n               are not passive subjects within a QoL model. Michalos proposed four potential subjective\n               QoL assessment outcomes, including correctly perceived good or bad conditions (Real\n               Paradise and Real Hell), and \u201cfalse positive\u201d and \u201cfalse negative\u201d perceptions that\n               incorrectly evaluate good or bad conditions (Fool's Paradise and Fool's Hell). Consequently,\n               he argued while it is appropriate that an individual's evaluation of their QoL should\n               take precedence, it should not override all other factors. He proposed a \u201cgood life\u201d\n               must include personal satisfaction but should be based on conditions that are clearly\n               considered \u201cgood\u201d (based on objective, effective measurement) by all reasonable people.\n               Where the objective measure suggests poor conditions but individuals evaluate their\n               situation as \u201cgood,\u201d due to mental incapacity of any character, then \u201cwe are reasonably\n               warranted in over\u2010riding their judgments\u201d (p. 5308), provided \u201cwe\u201d are in agreement\n               on this issue.\nIn the ID QoL literature, therefore, this objective/subjective assessment dualism\n               is presented as fundamental and dynamic in nature. However, the issue of the extent\n               to which we are justified in imposing our view of QoL domains, or whether personal\n               choice is discounted for a person who, in Michalos\u2019 terms, appears to be in Fool's\n               Paradise, is debatable. Certainly, Edgerton (\n1990\n) was opposed to over\u2010riding the views of individuals with ID. He considered there\n               is a duty to ensure access to good housing, healthcare, recreational activities, and\n               so on, but that:\nWe must assure that it is persons with mental retardation (sic) who choose what they\n                        want, not we who choose for them. And if their choices do not invariably bring them\n                        a greater sense of well\u2010being, we should not then impose our choice on them. They,\n                        like the rest of us, should have the right to strive for satisfaction in life in their\n                        own way. And we must understand that some of them, like the rest of us, will be more\n                        successful than others\n. (Edgerton,\n1990\n, p. 158)\nEdgerton's view emphasizes choice and control but presupposes that persons with ID\n               will have mental capacity to choose from among options. The case is less clear cut\n               where an individual has severe or profound ID. Nevertheless, the point is well made\n               that we should not impose standards on others. For example, there may be situations\n               where we ourselves might reject the generally accepted \u201cgood\u201d life choice, knowing\n               full well the objective reality of the situation, because we want something different\n               for ourselves. This supports that the view that individual choice should not be over\u2010ridden\n               unless there are clear risks to health or survival, and the person demonstrably does\n               not have the mental capacity to make, or comprehend the potential or actual severe\n               consequences of a choice (in the United Kingdom this is enshrined in the Mental Capacity\n               Act, 2005). The place of the person in the model is therefore an important consideration\n               in the development of a conceptualization of QoL.\nSo what does psychological theory add to this discussion? It suggests that personal\n               characteristics influence whether different people perceive the same life circumstances\n               as contributing to a \u201cgood\u201d QoL. It suggests that any assessment of QoL may only provide\n               a \u201csnapshot\u201d of a person's view of their life situation at that moment because of\n               the passing impact of short\u2010term events and enduring impact of underlying disposition\n               or temperament. To obtain a representative evaluation, therefore, it may be necessary\n               to undertake a series of assessments to establish a consistent profile of an individual's\n               QoL. In terms of development of interventions, support services or opportunities to\n               achieve valued life goals, some understanding of individual difference appears warranted\n               to enable a proactive, rather than reactive, approach that facilitates a person\u2010driven\n               (and avoids a wholly researcher/service provider driven) agenda for assessing QoL\n               that recognizes the place of the person at its centre.\nPart 2: Model Derivation\nThe Proposed Model of QoL\nThe sections above outline the history of progress toward development of a QoL model,\n               and some of the wider psychological literature addressing key factors relating to\n               individuals that require consideration in a QoL assessment. Below, a model of QoL\n               is proposed that aims to bring significant theoretical literature together to inform\n               a model representing the \u201cnature\u201d of QoL that may be used to guide such assessments.\nFour major literatures underpin the model presented here, principally that of Maslow\n               (\n1987\n) on Personality and Motivation (representing influence of individual characteristics);\n               but also the economic orientated theory (representing contextual influences) postulated\n               by Sen (\n1985\n) and colleagues on the Capability Approach (CA); Self\u2010Determination Theory (representing\n               the place of the person in the model) proposed by Deci and Ryan (\n1985\n); and contemporary QoL research (representing agreed domains important to QoL) within\n               the ID field (e.g., Cummins,\n2005\n; Renwick & Brown,\n1996\n; Schalock & Verdugo,\n2002\n).\nQoL and Maslow's Theory of Motivation and Personality (1970, 1987)\nMaslow began working in the field of \u201cMotivation and Personality\u201d in the mid\u20101950s,\n               and honed his theory over the following 15 years to establish the \u201cHierarchy of Needs\u201d\n               (HoN) we know today (Maslow,\n1970,\n1987\n). While Maslow himself did not refer to his work in terms of QoL it is evident that\n               in \u201cfulfilling\u201d the individual \u201cneeds\u201d identified, the person would gain an improvement\n               in their life quality.\nIn this work, Maslow related \u201cmotivations,\u201d which drive individuals to act, to personality.\n               In describing the motivating prompts, he organized them within a hierarchical structure.\n               Maslow (\n1987\n) proposed six levels to what he calls a \u201c\npositive\ntheory of motivation,\u201d in a determined move away from the predominant deficit models\n               of human experience and psychology common in the first half of the 20th century. He\n               suggested the more basic, or fundamental a need was considered, the more likely it\n               was to be addressed by undertaking the actions required to fulfill it. In other terms,\n               an individual's actions are prompted by the circumstances the person finds themself\n               in. Maslow (\n1987\n) described human needs within this hierarchy, starting with the most fundamental\n               and concluding with the \u201chighest,\u201d summarized here as follows:\nPhysiological\u2014\nincluding very basic bodily functions necessary for life, (e.g., the need for oxygen);\n                     and \u201cnon\u2010homeostatic\u201d needs for sleep, activity, sex, \u201cmaternal behavior,\u201d and so\n                     on.\nSafety\u2014\nincluding security and stability; protection from harm; freedom from anxiety, fear,\n                     and chaos; structure/law and order.\nBelongingness and Love\u2014\nincluding giving and receiving affection; friends, a mate, children; roots, a neighborhood,\n                     clan, or other grouping such as work colleagues.\nEsteem\u2014\nincluding a stable form of high evaluation of self; self\u2010respect; esteem from others\n                     (reputation or prestige).\nSelf actualization\u2014\nincluding engagement in activities that use personal talents (such as for music, athletics,\n                     invention, or parenting); to achieve concomitantly with aspirations.\n\u201c\nAesthetic\u201d needs\u2014\nincluding craving/preference for symmetry, closure, completion of the act, system,\n                     and/or structure primarily in the (built) environment. This last \u201cneed\u201d does not feature\n                     strongly in his discussion of the model.\nWhile Maslow (\n1987\n) argues that the HoN is not a \u201cfixed order,\u201d he proposes that for \u201cmost people\u201d motivations\n               will initially focus on the most basic levels of need and once satisfied, the person\n               will shift focus (consciously or unconsciously) to needs at higher levels. He noted\n               exceptions to this, for example, the \u201cstarving artist in the garret\u201d who is so transfixed\n               by expressing their talent they overlook needs for adequate nutrition or sleep, and\n               where a person gives up their job to save their self\u2010respect but as a consequence\n               loses income putting themself at risk of hunger, or losing their shelter. In this\n               way, Maslow acknowledges that, in terms of \u201ca list,\u201d the HoN will be context dependent.\n               The \u201cneeds\u201d are interrelated and arguably equally important for the well\u2010being (or\n               QoL) of the individual.\nEarly models of QoL have been partly informed by Maslow's HoN, but have not been based\n               on this theory directly (e.g., Solomon et al.,\n1980\n, pp. 223\u2013233). It is also possible to identify synergies between QoL research and\n               Maslow's work, in selection of \u201cvariables\u201d included in a National Quality of Life\n               Index (Diener,\n1995\n, p. 110), and more recently policy initiatives on rural \u201cQoL\u201d (Brauer & Dymitrow,\n2014\n). Researchers have also investigated development of a QoL model based directly on\n               Maslow's HoN using statistical modeling (Kravetz,\n2014\n). The modeling assumed the HoN has a strict hierarchical structure (disputed here),\n               and applied \u201cfacet theory\u201d to investigate items generated to represent levels of the\n               HoN. The analysis produced a structure with some similarity to, but ultimately inconsistent\n               with Maslow's HoN (Kravetz, Florian, and Wright, 1985; Kravetz and Katz, 1997 cited\n               in Kravetz,\n2014\n). Maslow's (\n1970,\n1987\n) HoN has therefore been influential in QoL model development, but its hierarchical\n               structure has not been supported. Nevertheless, it arguably offers a comprehensive,\n               theoretically driven structure through which to investigate QoL for any individual.\nQoL and Sen's Capability Approach (1985)\nThe work of Sen and colleagues on the CA (Sen,\n1985\n) has been another major contribution in the QoL field. What drives the approach is\n               assessment of well\u2010being (or QoL), and judgments about equality or justice, or the\n               extent of development of communities or countries toward acceptable QoL for different\n               populations. Its primary focus is on the effective opportunities people have to lead\n               a life they value. To this end, CA is more concerned with the social and environmental\n               conditions that facilitate well\u2010being, than with individual experience.\nThe core concepts underlying the approach include \u201cFunctions\u201d and \u201cCapabilities.\u201d\n               \u201c\nFunctions\n\u201d are described as \u201cbeings and doings\u201d and relate to the status of individuals, where\n               attributes such as a person \u201cbeing\u201d well\u2010fed and literate is held to demonstrate they\n               are in a good state \u201cfunctionally\u201d in these respects. \u201c\nCapabilities\n\u201d are described as real opportunities, and \u201cfreedoms\u201d (which relate to a person's\n               autonomy in engaging with such opportunities) to \u201crealize functionings\u201d (Sen,\n1985,\n2004\n). That is, to have access to resources (opportunity) and to be unfettered in those\n               actions required (have freedom) to \u201cbecome\u201d well\u2010fed or literate. These capabilities\n               and freedoms, then, relate to provision of a \u201cgood environment\u201d for attainment of\n               functionings. This resonates with Maslow's position as he noted, \u201c\na good environment (in theory) is one that offers all necessary raw materials and\n                  then gets out of the way \u2026 to let the [(average) person] utter [their] wishes and\n                  demands and make [their] choices\u2026\n\u201d (Maslow,\n1987\n, p. 120). They are the key contextual factors providing a person an opportunity to\n               achieve a valued QoL (Robeyns,\n2006\n).\nSen (1992, 1999, 2009 cited in Dang,\n2014\n) uses the term \u201cconversion factors\u201d to denote how \u201ccommodities or resources\u201d (raw\n               materials) are mediated to provide individuals with the capability to achieve functionings\n               (opportunities to fulfill needs) of one sort or another. Conversion factors comprise\n               three categories\u2014\npersonal\n(physical condition, age, gender);\nsocial\n(institutions, cultural, or social norms); and\nenvironmental\n(climate, pollution, and public facilities). Conversion of available resources into\n               well\u2010being is therefore seen as dependent on individual, social, and environmental\n               features. \u201cWell\u2010being\u201d is regarded as \u201c\nan assessment of the particular achievements of the person \u2013 the kind of \u2018being he\n                  or she succeeds in having\n\u201d (Sen\n1985\na and b in Dang,\n2014\n). In this context, \u201c\nagency freedom\n\u201d comprises \u201c\none's freedom to bring about the achievements one values and which one attempts to\n                  produce\n\u201d (Sen,\n1988\n), that is the freedom of individuals to \u201cdecide\u201d to act. This contrasts with \u201c\nfreedom from societal constraints\n\u201d upon a person that prevents them from acting on their choices.\nSen, however, is unwilling to generate a list of capabilities (Sen,\n2004\n). He suggests that making a list of important capabilities is easy, but of limited\n               use because they would be purely theoretical. He proposes any listing should arise\n               from social discussion and public participation on decisions about potential attributes.\n               He contends any list should be responsive to public opinion, and social or developmental\n               change. Lists may be devised for specific purposes but there should be no \u201cdefinitive\u201d\n               list.\nHowever, Sen (\n2004\n) notes the usefulness of Naussbaum's listing in relation to setting out minimal requirements\n               to tackle deprivation within society. Nussbaum (\n2003\n) argues that her proposed 10 Central Human Capabilities list (Life; Bodily Health;\n               Bodily integrity; Senses, Imagination and thought; Emotions; Practical reason; Affiliation;\n               Other species to have relationship with; Play; Control over one's environment) is\n               open and flexible, and notes that it has been revised several times and has broad\n               cross\u2010cultural consensus. Similarly, Sen himself participated in development of the\n               \u201cHuman Development Index\u201d for the United Nations Development Programme, which specifies\n               minimal requirements for QoL, calculable from available statistics, that would be\n               more informative than use of nations\u2019 Gross National Product or Gross Domestic Product\n               (Sen,\n2004\n). The important point to note here is that this list was created within a particular\n               context, for a particular reason.\nThe CA functionings identified by Sen (\n1985\n) and Nussbaum's (2003) Central Human Capabilities appear to have synergy with the\n               earlier work by Maslow (\n1987\n) in terms of \u201cpersonal conversion factors,\u201d and to also demonstrate synergies to\n               some extent between \u201cagency freedom\u201d and the work on Self\u2010Determination Theory by\n               Deci and Ryan (\n1985\n) discussed below. However, this theory is of particular relevance in signaling the\n               importance of contextual resources\u2014human and nonhuman, material and immaterial\u2014that\n               arguably impact QoL.\nQoL and Self\u2010Determination\nSelf\u2010determination is a concept underlying aspects of choice and control over one's\n               life, as briefly discussed above in relation to the place of the person within a model\n               of QoL. It is of particular importance to people with ID who historically have had\n               decision\u2010making opportunities removed, or considerably reduced, compared to the general\n               population. However, it is not only about \u201cchoice\u201d but aspiration and personal goal\n               setting. The idea that valued acts are those of inherent interest to individuals,\n               and the importance of having freedom to pursue such interests evident in CA, are captured\n               within Self Determination Theory (Ryan & Deci,\n2000\n). Ryan and Deci (\n2000\n) distinguish between individuals\u2019 motivations to act that arise from their own interests\n               and those occasioned by external pressures. They suggest different types of motivation\n               have specific consequences for learning, performance, personal experience, and well\u2010being\n               (p. 69).\n\u201c\nIntrinsic motivation\n\u201d prompts individuals to seek out novelty and explore; to be inquisitive, curious,\n               and playful; and incline toward knowledge acquisition and skill mastery. These types\n               of activities have \u201cinherent\u201d value for the person because they are driven by their\n               own interests. Ryan and Deci (\n2000\n) suggest that such pursuits represent the principal source of enjoyment and vitality\n               throughout life. This notion of inherent curiosity within the human species is also\n               ascribed to by Maslow (\n1987\n) who explored evidence for our desire to understand, systematize, organize, analyze,\n               look for relations and meanings, and construct a system of values. This propensity\n               to explore, investigate and learn may be argued to be responsible in large part for\n               individuals\u2019 early but also ongoing personal and social development.\nIn this regard, learning based on individual interest has been proposed to be most\n               \u201ceffective\u201d and satisfying, such that some independent schools and learning programs\n               have adopted this as a guiding principle (e.g., Summerhill, n.d., schools; Montessori,\n               n.d., approach). Within most societies, however, some scheme of formal education is\n               imposed in an effort to ensure individuals, and ultimately the wider population, have\n               at least a minimum, but also wide ranging, level of knowledge and skill. While these\n               are personally useful, they also contribute to local and national agendas in relation\n               to the well\u2010being of communities and ambitions of nations. In regard to enhancing\n               the QoL of people with ID, it underlines the importance of establishing personal interests\n               and aspirations and facilitating pursuit of these goals.\n\u201c\nExtrinsic motivation\n,\u201d then, is described as imposed by others and requires the person to exhibit particular\n               behaviors, for example, to undertake particular forms of learning in the classroom,\n               or tasks for an employer. Deci and Ryan (\n1985\n) propose that such imposition prompts a range of responses by the person from \u201c\namotivation\n\u201d (unwillingness to comply), and\npassive compliance\n, to\nactive personal commitment\n. They suggest that the type of response given is dependent on the extent to which\n               the person \u201cinternalizes\u201d (accepts the premise for) the required act or behavior.\n               When the requirement is fully accepted (internalized) it is integrated into their\n               \u201cworld view\u201d (they \u201cbelieve\u201d in it). Consequently, the person pursues the activity/behavior\n               \u201cas if\u201d it were intrinsically motivated, that is, as if they had decided on it themself.\nExtrinsic motivators therefore interact with the \u201cautonomy\u201d of the individual to determine\n               their subjective experience and actions. A person may concede that compliance with\n               an external demand aids them in pursuing an aspiration and so comply because it matches\n               that ultimate goal. Another person may only comply due to social pressure to conform.\n               Both these individuals complete the behavior/activity but in the former case there\n               is a \u201csense\u201d of choice (autonomy).\nRyan and Deci (\n2000\n) go on to suggest \u201ccompetence,\u201d \u201cautonomy,\u201d and \u201crelatedness\u201d are three basic human\n               needs. They suggest, for example, that extrinsically imposed acts are more likely\n               to be accepted (internalized) if the person experiences a sense of \u201c\ncompetence\n\u201d in completing the act. The task therefore provides a \u201creward\u201d of achievement even\n               if it was not of interest in and of itself. This may allow a person to grow in regard\n               to their self\u2010esteem; satisfying a \u201cneed\u201d to feel competent.\nAutonomy\nrelates to choice and control of life circumstances, such that \u201cautonomy supporting\u201d\n               approaches to teaching, for example, are thought to promote individual initiative\n               and effective learning. Ryan and Deci also contend that extrinsic motivations are\n               more acceptable if prompted by \u201cothers\u201d who are valued by the person. That is, the\n               demand emanates from someone they feel (or want to feel) \u201c\nrelated\n\u201d to, or who represents a group they identify with (i.e., they experience \u201ccommunality\u201d).\n               If the context in which the behavior is imposed allows the person to feel competent,\n               autonomous (that there is active choice in compliance) and \u201crelated\u201d (part of a valued\n               group\u2014communality) they are likely to see the act as congruent with their own goals.\nRyan and Deci (\n2000\n) suggest that, where it is possible to satisfy competence, autonomy and relatedness\n               needs (whether intrinsically or extrinsically motivated), the person will experience\n               personal well\u2010being, or health. Conversely, they suggest that deprivation will result\n               in ill health. This theory therefore stresses the importance of self\u2010determination\n               (choices) and within this freedom to act (control), along with achievement (esteem)\n               and sense of group identity (culture) in achieving a \u201cgood\u201d QoL. It suggests the goals\n               pursued should be one's own, or congruent with our ambitions, insofar as this is possible.\nMaslow (\n1987\n) proposed that a single \u201cact\u201d may be prompted by multiple motivations from across\n               the spectrum of needs defined within his HoN. He also suggested that the act of fulfilling\n               a need may become valued in itself through learning and change. For example, he states\n               that the athletic ability required to hunt and capture food, initially focused on\n               satisfying nutritional needs, may acquire a value of its own enhancing the proficient\n               hunter's need for \u201cself\u2010actualization\u201d by enabling them to use their talent for athleticism.\n               Foreshadowing Ryan and Deci's point in relation to deprivation of competence, autonomy,\n               and relatedness, Maslow suggested that frustration of attempts to fulfill a perceived\n               important need may have a negative impact on the individual's physical or mental health.\nThe literature presented thus far outlines the complex interplay, not just of the\n               needs of individuals and competing externally imposed and internally sought goals,\n               but also the intricate web of contextual resources, rights, opportunities, and cultural\n               influences that may enhance or frustrate achievement of personally valued QoL. While\n               Sen (\n1985\n) and Nussbaum (2003) have practised some caution in determining the contextual/resource\n               level \u201clist\u201d of needs required for a \u201cgood\u201d life, ID researchers have come some way\n               in outlining a number of important, apparently stable and reasonable \u201cdomains\u201d through\n               which to attempt measurement of QoL for people with ID, and arguably for any person.\nQoL Domains Identified through ID Research\nResearchers in the field of ID have highlighted the multidimensional nature of QoL\n               and explored the parameters of these dimensions (e.g., Bonham et al.,\n2004\n; Cummins,\n1996\n; Emerson,\n1985\n: Felce & Perry,\n1995\n; Renwick & Brown,\n1996\n; Schalock & Verdugo,\n2002\n; Scott, Foley, Bourke, Leonard, & Girdler,\n2013\n; Wehmeyer & Schwartz,\n1998\n). Importantly, cross\u2010cultural work on the indicators (and/or domains) of QoL (Schalock\n               et al.,\n2005\n) has investigated their \u201c\nuniversally shared\n\u201d (individual) and \u201c\nculturally relevant\n\u201d (contextual) dimensions. This duality resonates with Sen's (\n1985\n) conceptualization of QoL based on \u201cfunctionings\u201d and \u201ccapabilities,\u201d where functionings\n               are within the purview of individuals, whereas capabilities relate to the environmental\n               context and whether, or to what extent, this facilitates individual efforts/growth\n               toward a valued QoL. Based on previous work in the field (Schalock & Verdugo,\n2002\n), well established domains of \u201ccore QoL\u201d were investigated across five countries\n               (Spain, Latin America, the United States, Canada, and China). This study confirmed\n               universal aspects of the eight domain structure of QoL proposed (Schalock et al.,\n2005\n). The findings in relation to culturally determined aspects were more equivocal with\n               ratings of some items within domains varying with cultural setting. However, the findings\n               did not dispute the overarching domains. Such findings appear congruent with Maslow\n               and Sen's propositions that while individuals will have the same underlying needs,\n               their context, or culture, will moderate how these are responded to. It also supports\n               the notion of a need for flexibility in response to individuals\u2019 circumstances, in\n               use of models of QoL.\nTheoretical Framework of the QoL Model\nThe \u201cdomains\u201d of QoL emerging from the ID literature discussed above (Cummins,\n1996\n; Schalock & Verdugo,\n2002\n; Schalock et al.,\n2005\n), embody important aspects of a person's lived experience, that are flexible enough\n               to encompass dimensions proposed in earlier QoL research, such as those of Renwick\n               and Brown (1996). These domains are:\nrights, social inclusion, self\u2010determination, physical well\u2010being, personal development,\n                  material well\u2010being, interpersonal relations, and emotional well\u2010being\n.\nSchalock and Verdugo's (\n2002\n) eight QoL domains listed above, can be viewed as elements within which (in Maslow's\n               terms) \u201cneeds\u201d exist. If and when these needs are fulfilled, it is reasonable to suggest\n               a consequent, commensurate improvement in QoL for the individual may be expected to\n               follow. However, while the eight domains indicate important aspects of life, they\n               do not in themselves describe an associated concept of QoL. Providing a conceptual\n               framework based on Maslow's (\n1987\n) HoN influenced by Sen's (1985) CA and able to take Schalock and Verdugo's (\n2002\n) domains into account, appears helpful in this regard. That is, the HoN provides\n               facets of QoL that are arguably fundamental to a comprehensive, holistic conceptualization\n               of its nature into which contextual features may be accommodated, and the place of\n               the person recognized.\nIn Table\n1\n, domains identified by key researchers in the ID field are mapped to Maslow's HoN.\n               Here, \u201cgeneric\u201d domain names commonly used in ID QoL research are provided and have\n               been used to subsume other labels that are strongly related to the generic term.\nTable 1.\nDomains of quality of life identified in ID research mapped to Maslow's hierarchy\n                  of need\nID QoL Domains\na\nMaterial wellbeing\nHealth/Physical wellbeing\nEmotional wellbeing\nIntimacy\nInterpersonal Relations\nCommunity\nSocial Inclusion\nSafety\nPersonal Development\nSelf Determination\nProductivity\nRights\nSchalock et al.

Table\n1\nshows Schalock et al.'s (\n2005\n) domain of \u201c\nRights\n,\u201d Cummins\u2019 (1996) domain of \u201c\nProductivity\n\u201d (related to activity, learning, and employment), and the jointly identified domain\n               of \u201c\nMaterial Well\u2010being\n\u201d (related to housing, finance, and possessions: Cummins,\n1996\n; Schalock et al.,\n2005\n) are not represented in the HoN, arguably because these reflect contextual and not\n               individual aspects important for QoL/well\u2010being. However, Maslow includes such notions\n               in what he terms the \u201cpreconditions\u201d necessary to fulfill needs (Maslow,\n1987\n, p. 22). Sen (1992) and Nussbaum's (2003) work on CA, recognizes that an individual's\n               \u201cfunctionings\u201d require concomitant \u201ccapabilities,\u201d including rights, productivity,\n               and other elements of material well\u2010being, if they are to be achieved. That is, that\n               contextual resources, freedoms, and opportunities should be available to individuals,\n               to facilitate achievement of a functional status representing a personally satisfying,\n               or \u201cgood\u201d life. The contextual dimension, vital in supporting QoL, was addressed comprehensively\n               in the model proposed here.\nThe broad structural coherence of the domains identified in the above literature,\n               have been rationalized into a framework outlining four \u201cfacets\u201d of QoL adapted from\n               Maslow's (\n1987\n) HoN, each of which has two aspects representing individual and contextual features.\n               The facets are named\nFoundational well\u2010being\n(Maslow\u2014physiological and safety),\nPsychosocial well\u2010being\n(Maslow\u2014love and belonging),\nStatus\n(Maslow\u2014esteem), and\nAutonomy\n(Maslow\u2014self\u2010actualization).\nIn this QoL model, each facet is conceived as fundamentally intertwined with every\n               other (as visually represented in Figure\n1\n). The framework is pluralistic. In a development from Maslow's original concept,\n               it recognizes the \u201cexceptions\u201d he identified, that challenged the notion of hierarchy\n               (Maslow,\n1987\n, pp. 26\u201327), as an integral part of the model. This conceptualization is essential\n               as each facet is considered equally important and \u201cnontradable\u201d (Brown et al.,\n2013\n) as a determinant of QoL. See Figure\n1\n.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nQuality of life experienced by individuals.\nCaption\nQuality of life experienced by individuals.\nEach facet of the Model in Figure\n1\nreflects a coherent cluster of \u201cneeds\u201d (Maslow,\n1987\n) reflecting domains and indicators proposed by ID researchers (e.g., Schalock et\n               al.,\n2005\n). The facets and their individual and contextual aspects are described in Table\n2\n. The descriptors included are indicative and not absolute. In Sen's (\n2004\n) terms, furnishing an \u201cabsolute\u201d list of criteria is not feasible and possibly counterproductive.\n               Indeed, Maslow observed that the HoN level of detail is a function of the degree to\n               which any dimension is focused upon. As the degree of \u201cmagnification\u201d is increased\n               so a level of detail, formerly invisible, becomes apparent (Maslow,\n1987\n, p. 8). A model of QoL must be flexible enough to be responsive to different purposes,\n               contexts, and individuals, while retaining clarity of concept at its core. This was\n               the aim here.\nTable 2.\nQuality of life model\u2014facets, aspects, and elements\nIndividual aspect\nContextual aspect\nAutonomy: Self\u2010actualization\nAspiration/personal development\nSelf\u2010actualization\n\u2010 Employing personal talents\n\u2010 Following own interests\nSelf\u2010realization\n\u2010 Having self\u2010awareness/self\u2010knowledge\nSelf determination\n\u2010 Pursuing own choices/goals/aspirations\nSelf\u2010regulation\n\u2010 Maintaining efforts to reach goals\nEnvironmental \u201cease\u201d\n\u2010 Gaining pleasure/comfort from one's surroundings\nEmpowerment\nEducation/Learning\n\u2010 Freedom to investigate/research\n\u2010 Access to \u201ceducation\u201d\nEmployment\n\u2010 Access to fulfilling occupation\nPersonal Services\n\u2010 Support to pursue aspirations\nStatus: Esteem\nSelf esteem\nStable positive evaluation of self/competence\nPerceived high reputation/prestige\nSelf\u2010respect\nPerceived personal adequacy/competence\nSelf\u2010worth/perceived usefulness in the world\nCommunity Status\nAccepted community member\nValued community member/prestige\nRights/norms\nFreedom to:\n\u2010Speak/act/defend oneself\nAccess to:\n\u2010Justice/Fairness/Honesty\nSocial\nCommunity facilities\n\u2010Provided for public good\nSocial groups\n\u2010 Based on common pursuits\nAction groups\n\u2010 Based on common cause/mutual support\nPsychosocial well\u2010being: Love and belonging\nCommunality\n\u201cRoots\u201d/cultural/ethnic/social group\nShared identity\nCompanionship\nShared life experience\nIntimacy\nAttachment [to caregiver(s)\u2014child]\nPartnership\nSexual relationship\nProcreation\nInterpersonal Relationships\nCommunity facilities/opportunities/freedoms for social interaction\nPositive (mutually beneficial) supportive interactions with/in:\n\u2010 Personally defined \u201cnuclear family\u201d\n\u2010 Extended family\n\u2010 Friends/Acquaintances\n\u2010 Neighborhood\n\u2010 Nation/state (recognized member vs. outcast)\nFoundational well\u2010being: Safety and Survival\nPhysiological well\u2010being\nNutrition\nRest\nHygiene\nActivity\nSafety well\u2010being\nProtection (from harm)\nPredictability/dependability\nReserves (insure against unknown)\nFamiliar environments\nGuidance/moral code (e.g., religious/spiritual philosophy)\nMaterial well\u2010being\nShelter\nFood, water, other essential consumables\nFacilities: cooking/hygiene rest/travel\nFinancial\n\u2010 Access to sufficient funds\n\u2010 Opportunity to earn\nPersonal Safety and Well\u2010being\nHome\n\u2010 Stable/Secure\nCommunity\n\u2010 Law and order\n\u2010 Opportunities for activity/health support\nEnvironment\n\u2010 Benign\nTable\n2\ndescribes the four facets of the model, and its individual and contextual aspects.\n               \u201cIndividual\u201d aspects represent QoL in respect of the person to whom the model is applied.\n               These aspects contain \u201celements\u201d representing a range of \u201cneeds\u201d of potential significance\n               within that facet for the QoL of an individual. \u201cPotential\u201d because the importance,\n               or salience, of each element is likely to vary for any individual over time depending\n               on their perceived and actual life circumstance. \u201cContextual\u201d aspects of each facet\n               represent typical material and immaterial resources important in providing the conditions\n               (opportunities, freedoms, and social and environmental \u201cconversion factors,\u201d (Sen\n               (1992), cited in Dang,\n2014\n) to enable \u201cneed\u201d fulfillment.\nFoundational well\u2010being\ncombines Maslow's (\n1987\n) \u201cPhysiological\u201d and \u201cSafety\u201d HoN levels. The elements here include personal \u201cneeds\u201d\n               and contextual resources necessary for functioning as a biological entity and address\n               the critical \u201cneed\u201d to be safe, to feel comfortable that life is threat free. Both\n               \u201cphysical\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d needs are considered fundamental for a good QoL.\nPsychosocial well\u2010being\nconcerns the personal connections we have to others in our milieu, that are important\n               for mental health, and the conditions necessary to make and maintain such connections.\n               Human beings are largely social in nature, we therefore seek relationships with others\n               that occur at a number of levels. We seek\nIntimacy\nto satisfy our need for strong personal attachment with someone who will be our life\n               and sexual partner, and with whom we seek to raise children;\nCompanionship\nof others with whom to share life experiences; and\nCommunality\nwith those among whom we sense a shared identity. Successfully fulfilling these needs\n               in a personally valued way is important for psychological well\u2010being and a \u201cgood\u201d\n               QoL.\nStatus\ncomprises individual characteristics related to what Maslow termed \u201chigher needs\u201d\n               (1987) and relates to elements of \u201cesteem.\u201d This involves a person's estimation of\n               themself, and the esteem (and respect) they perceive, and attain from their local\n               and wider communities. These elements are facilitated through freedoms and opportunities\n               to access public institutions, and reflect extent of recognition of a person's rights\n               and normative status (acceptance) within their community.\nAutonomy\nis aligned with Maslow's \u201chigher need\u201d of \u201cself\u2010actualization\u201d (and within that aestheticism).\n               \u201cSelf\u2010actualization\u201d is considered to be part of a wider group of needs relating to\n               individuals\u2019 intrinsically motivated (self\u2010directed) goals and aspirations. It is\n               arguably dependent on fulfilling other needs, including the need for a person to be\n               self\u2010aware, to set their own goals, and to maintain efforts in reaching these goals.\n               These goals and aspirations are underpinned by a context where freedoms, opportunities,\n               and support are available to pursue valued goals.\nPart 3: Discussion\nThe Nature of QoL\nThe person within this QoL model is highly interconnected with their context, and\n               not isolated from it. The nature of QoL is, therefore, characterized by \u201cself\u2010society\u2010place\u201d\n               interactions within and between each of the four proposed facets. \u201cSelf\u201d (the person),\n               \u201csociety,\u201d and \u201cplace\u201d represented within the model are briefly outlined below.\nSelf\n: is highly evident throughout the model as only the person may make authentic judgements\n               about how they experience their QoL. So, what are the aspects of \u201cself\u201d that impact\n               this assessment? The literature demonstrated that a person's characteristics, such\n               as genetic disposition and personality, values engrained through socialization, and\n               short lasting events and states such as mood, influence a person's evaluation of their\n               QoL. The foundation of a person's QoL is represented as possession of optimal physical\n               condition, and sense of/actual safety and security in life. Beyond this, individuals\n               are inclined to seek out new experiences, investigate, and seek to attain new skills.\n               A sense of well\u2010being and personal satisfaction is gained when they determine their\n               life course in this way (Maslow,\n1987\n; Ryan & Deci,\n2000\n). Possession of knowledge, skills and other attributes society values, impacts their\n               status. Self\u2010respect (perceived competence in areas of personal importance\u2014Ryan &\n               Deci,\n2000\n) and self\u2010worth (perceived usefulness in the world) are jointly manifest in their\n               level of self\u2010esteem. Similarly, where a person gains esteem from their community,\n               and they perceive they are accepted and well thought of (achieve \u201crelatedness\u201d\u2014Ryan\n               and Deci,\n2000\n) their psychological well\u2010being is enhanced (Maslow,\n1987\n). Here self\u2010determination, especially pursuit of intrinsically motivating goals (Ryan\n               & Deci,\n2000\n) appears constituent to QoL. Renwick and Brown's (\n1996\n) CHP model supports this proposition arguing \u201cdegree of control\u201d moderates perceived\n               QoL. Self\u2010determination is considered at its peak where in pursuing their goals individuals,\n               inspired by intrinsic interest, employ their own particular talents [self\u2010actualization\u2014Maslow,\n1987\n; \u201cautonomy\u201d\u2014Ryan & Deci,\n2000\n).\nSelf\u2010determination, therefore, underlies negotiation of this QoL model privileging\n               the view of the person, though the necessity of concurrent objective assessments of\n               QoL remains. This includes the freedom to make \u201cill\u2010advised\u201d choices where this is\n               clearly an informed decision (Edgerton,\n1990\n). This description of the nature of \u201cself\u201d outlines personal characteristics that\n               impact achievement and evaluation of QoL. However, QoL is not wholly determined by\n               individual factors; contextual features are also key.\nSociety\n: is hugely influential on both the person and other contextual features of life,\n               and so fundamental in defining the nature of QoL. The nature of \u201cSociety,\u201d and how\n               it impacts QoL, is therefore important as it offers explanations on how individual\n               and contextual aspects of QoL may interact. Deleuze and Guattari (1980, cited in Dolwick,\n2009\n) propose \u201cthe social\u201d is a combination of \u201cpeople, groups, things, and ideas\u201d that\n               are interconnected such that, for example, the person and political states are not\n               separate but \u201cplugged in\u201d to each other and continually evolving into something different.\n               This suggests \u201cindividual\u201d and \u201ccontextual\u201d aspects of QoL are locked in interactions\n               that can enable or hinder achievement, or progress toward goals that are aspired to.\n\u201cSociety\u201d is therefore conceptualized as comprising human individuals and nonhuman\n               entities, including other species, material objects (produced or natural) and immaterial\n               objects (such as laws, traditions, events), and characterized by interactions between\n               persons, and persons and \u201cthings.\u201d Interactions with \u201cthings\u201d however, have been considered\n               of a different order to human interaction because things do not have capacity to decide\n               to act, or be \u201cmotivated\u201d to act. It was suggested that people \u201cact on\u201d things, but\n               not with, through or in response to them (Durkheim,\n1938\n). In this QoL model, however, it is accepted that relationships are more complex\n               than this suggests. For example, nonhuman animals do have the capacity to act, based\n               on motivating factors of relevance to that animal (e.g., Mellor,\n2016\n). Material objects, though they have no capacity to act based on motivating factors,\n               have a physical reality that is subject to contextual factors that may render them\n               changed and so impact persons, affecting their QoL. Immaterial objects, often created\n               through actions of social groups, may be designed to impact on persons, to create\n               order, engender bonding in social groupings, or provoke an emotional response in relation\n               to aesthetics (e.g., music, spirituality). These objects embody a secondary representation\n               of individual/group generated motivators and/or \u201cdirectives.\u201d As such these nonhuman\n               entities are considered to have the potential to be important contextual determinants\n               of, or foci for a person's subjective evaluation (and objective assessment) of QoL.\n               \u201cSelf,\u201d therefore, is defined by individual physical and psychological characteristics,\n               but also entirely enmeshed in \u201cthe social.\u201d However, both self and society are embedded\n               within \u201cplace\u201d which plays a key role in shaping both.\nPlace\n: refers to elements of context relating to the physical environment, both natural\n               and built and includes elements such as climate, pollution, and public facilities\n               (Sen, 1992, 1999, 2009 cited in Dang,\n2014\n). While environmental quality is partly determined by our activities that impact\n               upon it, its activities impact on us, and so it is constituent to QoL. Within a defined\n               geographical region the extremes of weather or geological movements, beyond the control\n               of society, will affect all and run their course, impacting QoL. However, aspects\n               of the built environment may differentially affect individuals due to society's response\n               to population needs. A society's efforts in accommodating \u201cneeds,\u201d such as provision\n               of electricity for light, heat, work objects, and entertainment, mean that most of\n               its people may be enabled to live a comfortable life. However, where specific needs\n               are overlooked, individuals are negatively impacted by elements of the built environment.\n               Access and other needs of people with disabilities have clearly been affected in this\n               way; despite contemporary efforts in, for example, facilitating physical access to\n               the built environment. While such impacts are socially determined, they occur outside\n               direct social interaction in the context of \u201cplace.\u201d In this model, therefore, individuals\u2019\n               QoL is considered to be impacted by the \u201cplace\u201d they are in, their \u201csocial\u201d contacts,\n               and characteristics that define their \u201cself,\u201d which combine to facilitate or thwart\n               experience of a \u201cgood\u201d QoL.\nThere is much that might be \u201cunpacked\u201d from this model and the notions that underpin\n               it. However, it is important here to consider use of the model, and so key points\n               arising from the conceptualization and presentation above are briefly discussed below.\nUse of the Model\nThe worth of any model of QoL is in doubt if it cannot be applied to help facilitate\n               actions to promote and improve life circumstances. Hence the implications for use\n               of this model are considered below. Here, it has been argued that any assessment of\n               QoL should be based on an understanding of its nature. Its nature is complex, and\n               so theories underlying this model suggest a necessity for generic descriptors in holistic\n               conceptualisation of QoL (Maslow,\n1970,\n1987\n; Sen,\n1985\n); that specificity needs to be added in its application to ensure relevance to those\n               circumstances evaluated. In using the model, it follows that the\npurpose\nmust be clearly defined and related facets and elements delineated. However, investigation\n               of QoL demands a pluralistic approach, which engages fully and equally with individual\n               and contextual aspects of a defined circumstance of interest; but also accounts for\n               influences of, and on facets of the model not under direct investigation. In mapping\n               out and assessing the aspects and elements of a specified circumstance, an open\u2010minded\n               exploratory approach appears key in tapping the evident interrelationships between\n               individual (self) and context (society\u2014place). Here, Latourian actor\u2010network theory\n               (ANT) appears of some relevance (Latour,\n2005\n). ANT is a complex and controversial theory based on ethnographic approaches to sociological\n               theorising. However, Latour (\n2005\n, p. 131) also stated \u201c\n[ANT] is a tool to help describe something, not what is being described\n.\u201d It is in this sense of being a tool designed to capture\nany\nelements relevant to a situation of interest that has value here.\nLatour (\n2005\n) proposed ANT derives insights using ethnomethodology, and allows governmental/social\n               and personal elements to be accounted for within a unified analysis of a set of circumstances.\n               An \u201cactor\u2010network\u201d would inform investigation (assessment) of QoL by making connections\n               between human and nonhuman entities (\u201cactors\u201d), related to a matter of \u201cconcern,\u201d\n               but importantly, make no a priori assumptions about what might be connected (Latour,\n1996\n). In general, these entities (humans, nonhuman species, material or immaterial objects)\n               are thought of as transforming each other and being transformed when they connect.\n               This idea of interactions having mutual consequences is appropriate to the QoL model\n               proposed. It has resonance with Michalos\u2019 (2014) point that the subjective evaluation\n               of circumstances by a person influences the actions they take in response, which in\n               turn impact not only the person (with ID) themself, but also others with whom they\n               connect. While this point related to interpersonal interactions, in an ANT \u201canalysis\u201d\n               a record is made of the impacts of and on all entities playing a role, including the\n               nonhuman (Latour,\n2005\n). Depending on the circumstances explored, wide ranging elements may be shown to\n               have important impacts on QoL, and must be accounted for (qualitatively and/or quantitatively)\n               if a realistic account of the circumstance is to be derived.\nThe psychological literature on SWB, and Day and Jankey's (1996) conclusion that individuals\u2019\n               life circumstances (QoL) are unique and likely to vary over time depending on what\n               is important to the person, make similar arguments regarding the fluctuating nature\n               of QoL. Their conclusions highlight the importance of flexibility in assessment, to\n               account for enduring individual differences (temperament/disposition) and short\u2010term\n               events arising from a person's mood, or wider context, that influence perception of\n               QoL. Any assessment can only grasp a snapshot of the elements of QoL (actor\u2010network)\n               available to us as researchers (or service providers) at that moment. Accordingly,\n               Latour (\n2005\n; Harman,\n2009\n) suggested an assessment should not take a \u201conce and for all\u201d approach, because it\n               is not an enduring representation. However, using a series of ANT assessments one\n               could examine layers of that circumstance over time (Harman,\n2009\n). It appears reasonable that comparison of temporally separate episodes of \u201cmapping\u201d\n               may provide insights on the influence of personal or contextual factors. This suggests\n               that QoL is likely to be represented by a profile rather than a single \u201cscore.\u201d In\n               supporting gains in QoL, this appears positive and potentially informative. Mapping\n               an individual's evaluation of their needs and aspirations, the extent to which they\n               are met, and connections to facilitating or obstacle creating contextual features\n               implicated in supporting or thwarting life goals, could provide a clear mandate on\n               which to seek to maintain or to improve/develop resources. However, it must be noted\n               that it has been beyond the scope of this article to fully explore existing literature\n               on issues implicated in application of overarching models to service applications.\nThe idea of embracing the evident complexity of QoL in pursuit of biopsychosocial\n               goals is appealing because it suggests an opportunity to get closer to a \u201creal\u201d evaluation\n               of QoL. ANT resonates with the QoL conceptualization here inasmuch as it characterizes\n               \u201cexperience\u201d as idiosyncratic; determined by contextual impacts on, the subjective\n               evaluation of, and responses by the individual concerned. It allows that the facets\n               and aspects of the QoL model are simultaneously and multiply \u201cactive\u201d in an individual's\n               life. Having defined a purpose, taking a nonjudgemental approach to what is included\n               within an evaluation of QoL supports the pluralistic stance of the QoL model proposed\n               here.\nWhat the QoL Model Contributes\nThe model proposed was conceptualized in the context of people in general and no group\n               specifically. People with ID, or other disabilities or complex needs, are entitled\n               to aspire to a QoL of the same order as any other person. Day and Jankey (\n1996\n) noted that early QoL models had different specifications because they were constructed\n               for use in different and restricted circumstances. Here, following Renwick and Brown\n               (\n1996\n), a comprehensive, holistic conceptualization of QoL is proposed so that it may inform\n               a range of uses. It is argued that realistic evaluation of QoL is dependent on an\n               understanding of its nature. Formerly, social/psychological indicators approaches\n               which focused on specific circumstances were dominant. These employed atheoretical\n               \u201cconcern\u201d derived, social policy goal, or researcher designated indicators in investigation.\n               In the literature reviewed, no underpinning concept of the nature of QoL was identified\n               and aspirational elements appeared missing. However, engagement with the cross\u2010discipline\n               QoL literature clearly demonstrates that the concept is vast and defies \u201cdefinitive\u201d\n               specification; those who attempt the task can easily become lost in a universe of\n               detail. The contribution here is, necessarily, a view of the concept at some distance,\n               allowing its shape to be outlined so the emerging QoL \u201catlas\u201d may provide a useful\n               guide.\nThis QoL model adopts Maslow's theories of motivation and personality, embodied in\n               his HoN (1970, 1987), and Sen's (1985) theories on the CA, in which \u201cgood\u201d QoL is\n               seen as dependent on achievement of \u201ccapabilities\u201d (opportunities) to realize \u201cfunctionings\u201d\n               (needs). Recognition of the person in the model was established through emphasis on\n               self\u2010society\u2010place interactions, and the importance of self\u2010determination (including\n               choice and control) which may promote not only improvements in QoL, but gains in psychological\n               well\u2010being.\nIt is acknowledged that any model is only of value if it can inform actions to improve\n               the lives of individuals or groups\u2014that is, to underpin social, educational or clinical\n               policies, interventions, or services. It seems reasonable to suggest that a first\n               step in such action must be to assess current status and gain an understanding of\n               the person, their subjective and objective circumstances, experiences, preferences,\n               and aspirations. Critically, the goal of QoL evaluation should be valued by the person\n               concerned (Amado, Stancliffe, McCarron, & McCallion,\n2013\n). Particular challenges faced by any individual will be constituent of, and impact\n               the outcome of QoL investigation. A QoL assessment, through identification of contextual\n               resources and personal strengths, should then arguably enable the person to strive\n               toward the QoL they aspire to.\nAs a guide (or \u201catlas\u201d), the model aims to support researchers and service providers\n               in their decisions as to what is relevant to a QoL assessment. It aims to overcome\n               some of the criticisms of models based on researcher defined domains by proposing\n               an exploratory approach to assessment of QoL, reflecting the dynamic nature of the\n               phenomenon. Here, an ANT type approach (Latour,\n2005\n) appears appropriate to capture this dynamism by mapping the impacts of identified\n               elements connected with the circumstances assessed. In this way, the person and the\n               wider circumstances themselves ultimately delineate what is relevant to that QoL evaluation.\n               Such assessments have potential to uncover what a person perceives, and objective\n               evidence reveals what their QoL is like. Moreover, it may also provide evidence to\n               explain those perceptions and revelations, and inform actions to address obstacles\n               to improved QoL.\nLimitations\nIt has been beyond the scope of this article to fully explore the implications of\n            the model for application in practice. It is also acknowledged that, while a cross\u2010disciplinary\n            approach was adopted, due to limitations of space \u201cbio\u201d features of \u201cself\u201d and wider\n            environmental features of \u201cplace,\u201d in particular, are relatively under\u2010defined. However,\n            in outlining the proposed nature, and a potential approach to assessment of QoL, a\n            step toward addressing such matters has been taken.\nIn terms of national assessments, where a \u201cfinger to the wind\u201d outcome is all that\n            is required and so an exploratory approach is not appropriate, it is suggested that\n            consideration of \u201cwhat\u201d data is collected can still be informed by this model of the\n            nature QoL. Further, through ongoing research using the model as a guide, a body of\n            evidence may be accumulated in relation to particular populations, or social circumstances,\n            to inform policy and practice.\nConclusion\nThis model was created to reflect psychological, social, and econometric theory on\n            the nature of QoL. It is proposed that recognition of the nature of this concept is\n            necessary if we are to realistically attempt to measure the QoL of individuals. An\n            informed measurement of QoL is, reasonably, fundamental to evidence based courses\n            of action seeking to improve the lives of specific populations. Interventions, services,\n            and support developed on the basis of such an understanding and assessment, may arguably\n            be more effective in achieving their objective. However, the model outlined here is\n            the beginning of a process moving toward such a goal, and not the end of it.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

Governments in developing countries spend a considerable\n            share of their resources in providing welfare services such as healthcare and education\n            in the implicit hypothesis that non\u2010availability of such welfare services at affordable\n            costs is a prime impediment to improve quality of life\n1\n,\n2\n. However, the effectiveness of such expenditure in achieving the desired welfare\n            objectives as reflected in the quality of life indices is often not very encouraging.\n            This is mainly because of the largely poor and rural nature of the majority of the\n            population in such countries, who do not have affordable mobility means to have access\n            to such service provision centres, which are generally located in towns and far away\n            from their villages. This inadvertently results in communities being socially excluded.\nThis deficiency of social inclusivity is recognised in literature as constraining\n            effective transformation of state welfare efforts into physical quality of life indices\n            in most of the developing countries. Not having adequate access to opportunities,\n            services and networks is increasingly considered as the crux of the problem\n3\n,\n4\n. Affordable and widespread transportation is now cited as a catalyst for facilitating\n            accessibility and is no longer considered important only for supporting economic activities\n            or for labour migration\n5\n.\nHowever, not all developing countries suffer from this phenomenon. Sri Lanka is one\n            such exception, where the poverty and rurality of a large majority of its population\n            do not appear to have been barriers to achieving high social quality of life\n6\n,\n7\n. Free healthcare and education services provided by the government, the factors widely\n            recognised in literature as determinants of the high quality of life indices of the\n            Sri Lankan society, appear to have been effective over the years, particularly in\n            the aftermath of the country's independence. The country has achieved these welfare\n            strides while its masses continued to live in agricultural hinterlands and not by\n            migrating into townships and cities where state\u2010run healthcare and education service\n            centres were located. In other words, poverty and rurality have not impeded accessibility\n            to welfare services, thus ensuring social inclusivity within the island. It is for\n            these reasons that the Sri Lankan experience in the post\u2010independence era is widely\n            referred to as an exceptional case of achieving social development\n7\n,\n8\n.\nThis paper briefly discusses how critical the social exclusion problem is\nvis\u2010\u00e0\u2010vis\nenhancing the quality of life in the developing countries, and what methods developing\n            countries have adopted in order to improve social inclusivity, in an attempt to understand\n            the pivotal role played in this regard by public transportation. Lessons are drawn\n            from comparatively examining the Sri Lankan experience in her post\u2010colonial social\n            development, where public transportation appears to have played a catalytic role of\n            ensuring social inclusivity through provision of affordable mobility solution to marginalised\n            communities suffering from lack of means of physical mobility of their own.\n2 Quality of Life, Welfare Service Provision and Social Inclusivity: A Comparative Analysis\nQuality of life indices in the low\u2010income developing countries are generally poorer\n            than that in the rich nations. The availability and affordability of healthcare and\n            education services are commonly cited determinants of this difference\n9\n. Unlike in the wealthy countries, such services are not widely available in the developing\n            world, and even those provided on welfare basis by the respective governments are\n            not easily accessible by the masses. This is because such service provision centres\n            are located far away from the deep rural habitats, and the rural poor do not have\n            mobility means of their own to travel to accede these services.\nThe importance of the access to basic services as an important facet of social inclusion\n            in developing countries is well understood in the literature\n4\n,\n10\n,\n11\n, and the nexus between permanent marginalisation (of societies) and unaffordable\n            mobility is that of a daunting one. The reasonable and practical means of mobility\n            available to the masses are vital to tackle the problem of the lack of physical accessibility,\n            which is claimed to be directly linked to poverty and ever\u2010prevalent health issues\n            in these countries\n3\n,\n4\n. However, it should be stressed that such mobility solutions have to be affordable\n            to the people for those to be realistic means of physical accessibility.\nOptimisation of already available resources and transport solutions and virtual mobility\n            do figure among the remedies suggested in order to ensure better social inclusion.\n            Parts of Asia and Africa are still heavily dependent on non\u2010motorised modes of transportation,\n            and a considerable proportion of peoples' daily transportation needs are covered by\n            such primary methods. Gina Porter\n4\nis of the view that mobility patterns and methods (mostly track\u2010road non\u2010motorised\n            modes) of off\u2010road villages can be optimised so that their own local transport system\n            remains efficient. The priority of establishing connectivity is thus recognised where\n            local governments are encouraged to do up and maintain the track roads enabling localised\n            methods of transportation until permanent mobility solutions are put in place. Kenyon\net al.\n3\nexplored literature on social exclusion and proposed virtual mobility as a solution.\n1\nSieber\n10\nconcluded that establishing foot paths and the provision of non\u2010motorised transport\n            modes such as donkeys and bicycles could ensure better economic gain and time saving\n            as well as improved access to basic services such as healthcare.\nHowever, as could be observed in literature, distances play an important role in determining\n            the success of such attempts of providing track\u2010road based non\u2010motorised transport\n            connectivity in significantly minimising the problem of exclusion of rural societies\n            from accessing healthcare or education services. This is because footpaths and track\n            roads for carts or bicycles could not provide reasonable access on a regular basis\n            to such service provision centres located far away from rural habitats, owing to the\n            slow speed of the mobility solutions enabled on such rural infrastructure, and the\n            resultant high travel times make commuting on a regular basis quasi impracticable.\n            Constructing motorable roads, on the other hand, would not provide an appropriate\n            solution for these low\u2010income developing countries, where the public, essentially\n            those who live in rural hinterlands, cannot afford to own private motorised transport\n            modes.\nIt is noteworthy, however, that Sri Lanka, in this domain, has been an exception.\n            It was still a lower income country with per capita GDP figuring below USD855 by the\n            dawn of the 21st century; yet, its people enjoyed very high living standards as reflected\n            in the country's physical quality of life indices (Figure\n1\n), which were more comparable to that of much advanced economies. The direct intervention\n            measures of the newly independent government in providing free healthcare, education\n            and food subsidies, widely acclaimed in literature as \u2018drivers\u2019 of higher quality\n            of life in the island\n12\n-\n15\n, would have played their due role. But, that alone cannot adequately explain as to\n            how barriers to social inclusion of a largely rural population living in hinterlands\n            were overcome. It is obvious that the free healthcare or education services could\n            not be found in close proximity of deeply rural and remote village settings, in spite\n            of the persistent efforts of the government to spread those services across the country.\n            Yet, the country appears to have successfully managed this problem without having\n            to face any large scale migration of people to urban or semi\u2010urban centres, where\n            the opportunities and welfare services are available, which is reflected by the relatively\n            high share of rural population in the country as late as in the year 2000 (Figure\n2\n).\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nPer capita incomes and physical quality of life indices(PQLIs) of different countries\n                     in the early 1980s.

Also, those could not have been private means of transport\n            as Sri Lanka's per capita income was never sufficiently high for a large majority\n            of its people, let alone the poor rural masses, to afford private vehicles. For instance,\n            the country's four\u2010wheeler vehicle ownership \u2013 nine vehicles for a thousand persons\n            in 1983 and 15 for a thousand persons as late as in 1995 \u2013 was well below the average\n            in the world and was a mere 29 for a thousand persons even as late as 2002\n16\n, as depicted by the Gompertz representation in Figure\n3\n.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nPrivate vehicle ownership per thousand persons in Sri Lanka and like\u2010income countries.\n                     Source: Authors' estimation of the Gompertz function for the world, using published\n                     data in Dargey, J, Gately, D, Sommer, M.

The parameters which contribute\n            to the physical quality of life index (PQLI)\n6\n,\n2\nnamely life expectancy, infant mortality, maternal mortality and literacy, are found\n            frequently referred to in the discussions on welfare status of a community. Although\n            the list of determining factors of quality of life by now has extended itself to include\n            the domains of political freedom and gender equality, the PQLI developed in the 1970s\n            and its aforementioned constituents were used for the purpose of this study. This\n            is mainly because the period of focus in this study is from the 1950s through to 1980,\n            and because it enables comparison among the achievements of developing countries in\n            the aftermath of the World War 2.\nIn Sri Lanka, the social welfare parameters have undergone a dramatic improvement\n            during the 1960\u20131980 period. Being ahead of fellow South Asian countries, and most\n            of the East Asian countries, in terms of life expectancy, infant mortality and adult\n            literacy rate, by the early 1960s\n17\n, Sri Lanka's improvement regarding these indices during the period under consideration\n            has been remarkable in comparison to similar\u2010income developing countries (depicted\n            in Table\n1\n). Infant mortality, for instance, has reduced from as high as 64 deaths per thousand\n            live births to 34 per thousand live births during this period, while the number of\n            maternal mortalities occurring per thousand live births also has come down significantly.\n            Life expectancy and literacy also have shown a persistent amelioration during the\n            same period (Figure\n4\n).\nTable 1.\nComparison of social development parameters and their improvement in Sri Lanka against\n               similar income countries (1960\u20131977).\nCountry\nGNP per capita (USD)\nLife expectancy (years at birth)\nInfant mortality rate (per thousand live births)\nAdult literacy rate (%)\n1960\n1977\n1960\n1977\n1960\n1977\nAfghanistan\n190\n34\n42\n\u2014\n179\n8\n12\nPakistan\n190\n44\n51\n184\n126\n15\n21\nSierra Leon\n190\n37\n46\n219\n172\n\u2014\n15\nTanzania\n190\n42\n51\n143\n111\n10\n66\nBenin\n200\n37\n46\n192\n135\n8\n11\nSri Lanka\n200\n63\n*\n69\n64\n*\n34\n*\n69\n*\n87\n#\nGuinea\n220\n35\n44\n\u2014\n179\n7\n\u2014\nHaiti\n230\n42\n54\n201\n138\n15\n23\nLesotho\n240\n42\n50\n141\n107\n\u2014\n40\nMadagascar\n240\n37\n46\n\u2014\n100\n\u2014\n50\nSources: Sen Amartya\n15\n, p. 288; Annual Reports of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka; and World Bank online database.\n                     [Remark: Estimates in different sources do not always tally]\n*\nData from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka were used\n#\nEstimate for 1981\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nMaternal mortality, infant mortality, life expectancy and literacy in Sri Lanka (1958\u20131980).\n                     Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Special Statistical Appendix (2002)\nCaption\nMaternal mortality, infant mortality, life expectancy and literacy in Sri Lanka (1958\u20131980).\n                        Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Special Statistical Appendix (2002)\nMany references could be found in literature pertaining to Sri Lanka's quality of\n            life achievement since independence, a large majority of those attributed this social\n            development to Sri Lanka's free education and health commitments.\n3\nAnand and Kanbur\n13\n, in their analysis of Sri Lanka's quality of life performance estimated a time\u2010series\n            equation:\nwhere, the dependent variable was one of infant mortality, death rate or birth rate.\n            The two autonomous terms were, respectively, the country specific intercept term and\n            the technical progress term.\nY\nit\nwas specified as GDP per capita, and three separate predictor variables for health,\n            education and food expenditure were depicted by\nE\nit\n.\nThe estimates taken for two different time periods (1960\u20131978 and 1952\u20131981) in the\n            same study revealed an interesting relationship. The direct intervention (represented\n            by health expenditure as the predictor variable) has turned out to be the only significant\n            contributor towards reducing infant mortality rate when the period between 1960 and\n            1978 was examined. However, the estimate of the same equation for 1952\u20131981 has picked\n            up income also as a significant determinant in addition to health expenditure. These\n            results indicate that income as a determinant of the quality of life could probably\n            be effective only in the long run, while welfare expenditure would play a significant\n            role, even in shorter periods of time, as a key determinant in shaping Sri Lanka's\n            quality of life.\nGunathilake\n18\nattempted an extension to the aforementioned Anand and Kanbur approach to explain\n            the decline in infant mortality rate for three time periods (1960\u20131978, 1952\u20131981\n            and 1952\u20131990) and found that infant mortality was not adequately explained by their\n            model owing to a specification error, namely the absence of other demographic determinants\n            in the model as explanatory variables. Two alternative models, with and without a\n            trend term, were tested by Gunatilake in order to explain the reduction in infant\n            mortality. In the model without a trend term, only health expenditure and income variables\n            significantly explained the reduction of infant mortality rate, quite similar to what\n            was concluded by Anand and Kanbur. However, the income variable became insignificant\n            in the model with a trend term, leaving only the health expenditure as a significant\n            determinant of infant mortality.\nIn a separate study, Anand and Ravallion\n13\nsuggested that Sri Lanka's elevation to the level of a \u2018test case\u2019 status was due\n            to government intervention through public welfare provision. The equation tested to\n            explain the drop in infant mortality in this study for the period 1952\u20131981 used real\n            per capita income and health subsidy expenditure as explanatory variables. The results\n            indicated that health expenditure has been a very significant contributor to the improvement\n            of infant mortality rate in Sri Lanka, while income variable was significant to a\n            much lesser extent. Sen\n15\nand Anand and Kanbur\n12\nalso found the rapid expansion in health service provision to be the drivers of Sri\n            Lanka's exceptional performance and identified the anti\u2010malarial campaign as the main\n            motivator behind the increase in health service provision during the 1970s.\nA number of other studies\n8\n,\n14\n,\n18\npoint to the Sri Lankan society's socio\u2010cultural inheritance, particularly her predominant\n            Buddhist Culture and Sinhalese Buddhist upbringing, as the main reason that made people\n            more responsive to human development.\n4\nThe question, however, remains unanswered as to how Sri Lanka managed to retain her\n            rural masses in their own village settings, thus avoiding exodus migration, enabling\n            them with the necessary mobility to benefit from state\u2010run welfare services. These\n            welfare services were stationed far away from their habitats, and their low average\n            incomes prevented them from owning and using private motorised vehicles.\nIt is this apparent dilemma that was examined in detail in the present study. The\n            hypothesis advanced by the authors was that the affordable mobility solution provided\n            to deep rural villages by the public bus services of the Ceylon Transport Board (CTB),\n            established as a nationalised service in 1958, would have effectively ensured inclusivity\n            of rural masses in the country\n5\n19\n,\n20\n. This hypothesis was tested statistically using appropriate econometric techniques,\n            where the significance of bus kilometres provided by the CTB as a variable was examined\n            among other commonly acclaimed determinants (such as the provision of free healthcare\n            and free education services), for its influence over the improvement of quality of\n            life parameters in Sri Lanka.\nBy testing this hypothesis, the objective of the researchers was to identify the determinant\n            role public transportation could play as a means of affordable mobility in effectively\n            bridging the accessibility gap between the needy society and welfare service provision\n            centres in the developing countries. The absence of such a widespread and affordable\n            public transport service provision could possibly have been among the reasons why\n            such countries trailed behind Sri Lanka in achieving a high level of social standing\n            of their people. It is curious that this possibility of a social inclusivity role\n            provided by affordable public transport service being behind Sri Lanka's exceptional\n            track record in improving the quality of life of her people has not caught attention\n            of the researchers.\n4 Methodology and Analysis\nIn the present study, social development parameters represented by the quality of\n            life indices were tested with their relevant health and education variables, together\n            with bus kilometres operated by the CTB as the proxy variable to represent the \u2018affordable\n            mobility\u2019 factor.\nThe period between 1958 and 1980 was covered by the present research. This period\n            was chosen for a number of reasons. First, it was the period during which the affordable\n            mobility for a wider range of the general public was provided by the single public\n            bus operator, the state\u2010owned CTB.\n6\nThe statistics pertaining to bus operations during this period could be reliably\n            obtained from a single source, namely the Sri Lanka Transport Board, the current successor\n            of the CTB, while no such data were available pertaining to bus services operated\n            prior to 1958 by the large number of privately owned and poorly regulated bus companies.\n7\nThe bus industry was deregulated in the early 1980s, and in the aftermath, privately\n            owned buses were allowed to provide services parallel to the state\u2010owned CTB buses\n            but without a regulatory mechanism or permits, thus leading such service provision\n            to go largely unaccounted for\n21\n. Therefore, the reliability of data and information pertaining to bus transportation\n            in the immediate aftermath is questionable. Second, the effect of liberalisation of\n            the economy towards the end 1970s represents a \u2018structural break\u2019 in the economic\n            parameters, and thus a longer time series covering periods before and after 1980 would\n            be rather complex and possibly meaningless. Third, the incomes of the people started\n            growing rapidly, and the private modes of transport, particularly motor bicycles,\n            became \u2018increasingly affordable\u2019 for the public. The modal share of motor bicycles,\n            for instance, doubled to 2 per cent by 1980 from being around a negligible 1 per cent\n            during the period between 1960 and 1978\n22\n; thus making bus travel no longer the only affordable means of mobility for the general\n            public. Two\u2010wheelers and three\u2010wheelers, for instance, represented 6 per cent of the\n            total transport market by the year 1992,\n8\nand studying correlations between transportation and welfare in such a context would\n            be parametrically different to an examination pertaining to the period before. Fourth,\n            Sri Lanka's welfare parameters had already reached significant heights by 1980 (Table\n1\n), and the strategic attributes behind that success, the focus of this study, have\n            to be researched in the period anterior. It is also understood that improvements in\n            welfare indices beyond such high levels would require exponentially greater efforts,\n            covering a wider range of attributes, and examination of which warrants a separate\n            study. Besides, this period was a globally significant era, where economic, scientific\n            and political power cited with the United States in the aftermath of the World War\n            II. Following such global developments, Britain, no longer being the supreme political\n            power, eventually granted its colonies independence, thus making it a significant\n            period for many developing countries.\nThe number of hospitals, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per thousand persons were\n            considered as candidates in choosing a health sector proxy, while the number of teachers\n            and the number of schools per ten thousand persons were subject to analysis in view\n            of representing the education service input. One of each from these categories were\n            selected to represent the health and education sectors, such that those chosen proxies\n            can best explain the effect of the two vital welfare service inputs. The selection\n            was not merely dependent upon statistical significance, but also on the practical\n            importance given the context of the study.\nFor instance, \u2018Number of Nurses\u2019, was chosen over other health sector variables as\n            literature suggested that it would better represent the health sector's efforts than\n            the others, given the period under study\n23\n,\n24\n. The health sector during the period under review was predominantly working towards\n            eradicating malaria in the island and towards improving maternal health and family\n            planning. Preventive healthcare was a prominent aspect in the policy agenda, and health\n            personnel, especially nurses and midwives, were deployed in mobile healthcare centres.\n            The role of these mobile and small\u2010scale health centres were to effectively connect\n            with the rural masses, to educate them and advocate preventive healthcare measures,\n            as well as to monitor the health issues arising in each village in order to refer\n            them to the nearest public health facility.\n9\nNurses were appointed to public schools on a full time basis to look into whether\n            the students were vaccinated and to monitor their nutrition levels.\nAs a result, the number of nurses per ten thousand population grew from almost three\n            nurses per ten thousand in 1958 to more than seven by 1980, a growth much faster than\n            that of the number of doctors during the same period (depicted in Figure\n5\n).\nFigure 5\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nEvolution of the number of doctors and nurses per ten thousand persons\u2013 1958\u20131980.\n                     Source: Author calculations and presentation based on Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Special\n                     Statistical Appendix (2002)\nCaption\nEvolution of the number of doctors and nurses per ten thousand persons\u2013 1958\u20131980.\n                        Source: Author calculations and presentation based on Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Special\n                        Statistical Appendix (2002)\nIt is therefore evident that the healthcare effort of the government went much broader\n            and deeper than what could possibly be reflected by the number of hospitals,\n10\nhospital beds or doctors, and thus, among the candidate determinants, the number\n            of nurses appeared the most suited proxy to represent the health sector input.\nWith regard to the \u2018education\u2019 proxy, the choice was between the number of teachers\n            and the number of schools. In a practical sense, the number of teachers would better\n            proxy the education service provision as (a) what matters more is the capacity to\n            deliver knowledge than the physical infrastructure, and (b) the number of teachers\n            as a variable is likely to capture the increase or decrease of the number of schools,\n            but the reverse does not necessarily happen. Therefore, the number of teachers per\n            thousand population, in spite of its limitations,\n11\nwas selected to represent the education service input.\nThe data on variables tested in the models were gathered from secondary sources, including\n            the\nSpecial Statistical Appendix\nof the Annual Report 2002 of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the World Bank Online\n            Database.\n4.1 Exclusion of income\nIt is evident from the literature that welfare expenditure has been the strongest\n               factor influencing the quality of life indices and not the per\u2010capita income or technology\n               advancement. In fact, the literature suggests that income cannot have a determining\n               effect on social indicators for short survey periods\n12\n,\n18\n. This could be explained by the fact that the importance of income as a determinant\n               of social development would be lesser to the extent that the essential services (which\n               are instrumental in reaching higher living standards) were provided free of charge\n               or at subsidised rates, which was effectively the reality in Sri Lanka during the\n               period under consideration.\n12\nBesides, public spending on free or subsidised healthcare, education and transport\n               services being part of the nation's per capita income, including income as a determinant\n               together with healthcare, education and mobility proxies, would result in a form of\n               double\u2010counting.\nThe study methodology therefore was so structured that the effects of the welfare\n               services on the quality of life parameters would be highlighted without being camouflaged\n               or distorted by the presence of an income variable.\nThe long run association of these selected determinants with the quality of life parameters\n               such as maternal mortality, infant mortality, life expectancy and literacy were tested\n               using the Angel\u2013Granger cointegration method. For this, the variables were first plotted\n               against time in view of observing their overall characteristics, followed by adopting\n               the Augmented Dicky\u2013Fuller methodology to test their stationarity. The multicollinearity\n               problem was assessed by looking at variance inflation factors.\n4.2 The Long run relationship\nThe model estimated was of the following nature.\nin which, for a given year,\nS\nt\n\u2013social sustainability parameter (maternal mortality, infant mortality, literacy and\n                           life expectancy separately) between 1958 and 1980\nH\nt\n\u2013health welfare parameter (number of nurses per ten thousand population)\nE\nt\n\u2013education welfare parameter (number of teachers per ten thousand population)\nM\nt\n\u2013accessibility parameter (CTB bus kilometres millions per ten thousand population)\nFollowing the Augmented Dicky\u2013Fuller test, all variables were found non\u2010stationary\n               at its level form and became stationary at first differences. The dependent variables\n               were then regressed at level form to confirm their statistical relationship with the\n               respective predictor variables using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. The\n               error terms were then tested for stationarity (at level form) to establish whether\n               a long\u2010term association exists in the models.\nThe outcomes of this analysis, however, have to be perceived in the context that it\n               was performed on time series of 23 data points, which is shorter than what is considered\n               statistically adequate. A longer data series could not be obtained owing to the limited\n               window of data availability; a result of the very nature of the question examined.\n               The analysis was thus performed using the entire population of data and adopted the\n               Angel\u2013Granger methodology instead of using the Johanson cointegration technique. It\n               is noteworthy also that the literature brings evidence to demonstrate researchers\n               having opted to examine even smaller data arrays\n13\nusing similar methods than not studying them when longer data series were naturally\n               unavailable\n12\n,\n25\n,\n5 Results\nThe results presented in Table\n2\nshow statistically significant relationships between three qualities of life indices,\n            namely infant mortality, maternal mortality and literacy, and the government's provision\n            of health, education and mobility, where OLS assumptions held. The Durbin\u2013Watson statistics\n            for all three models estimated were greater than one and showed no alarming autocorrelation\n            issues. Variance inflation factors ranged from 1.5 to 2.5, eliminating any serious\n            multicollinearity distress. Moreover, the possibility of heteroskedasticity was excluded\n            in all models by performing the Breusch\u2013Pegan\u2013Godfrey test. No statistically acceptable\n            relationship could be established with regard to life expectancy, where at least one\n            OLS assumption was violated in all the models examined.\nTable 2.\nThe output of the Angel\u2013Granger cointegration test.\nPredictor variable\nModel 1\nModel 2\nModel 3\nInfant mortality\nc\nMaternal mortality\nc\nLiteracy\nConstant\n7.07\n***\n9.10\n8.02\n***\n4.20\n3.14\n***\n9.95\nCTB Bus kilometres\nb\n(0.21)\n**\n(2.59)\n(0.85)\n***\n(4.21)\n0.14\n***\n4.54\nNurses\nb\n(0.20)\n(1.25)\n(1.26)\n***\n(3.25)\n0.14\n**\n2.47\nTeachers\nb\n(0.74)\n***\n(4.12)\n(1.61)\n***\n(3.67)\n0.28\n***\n4.25\nAdjusted R\n2\n0.79\n0.89\n0.89\nUnit root of error\n(3.62)\n(4.08)\n(3.32)\nP values\na\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\nWithin brackets are Standard Errors\nAll variables, both predictor and dependent are in log form\nt\u2010values and coefficients recorded in parenthesis are negative in value\n*\nfor t\u2010statistic significance under 10% significance level\n**\nfor t\u2010statistic significance under 5% significance level\n***\nfor t\u2010statistic significance under 1% significance level\na\n\u2013 MacKinnon (1996) one sided\np\n\u2010values\nb\n\u2013 per ten thousand population\nc\n\u2013 per thousand live births\nGiven that the models tested were in a log\u2013log form, the coefficients estimated in\n            this exercise represent elasticities of the respective dependent variables on the\n            corresponding determinants.\nAmong the models estimated, the most successful was that of the maternal mortality\n            with high R\u2010squared and with all three explanatory variables being statistically significant.\n            The best model for infant mortality had health proxy as a statistically insignificant\n            variable, while the model with the best explanatory power for literacy had it significant\n            only at 5 per cent level.\nAccording to these results, the variable representing affordable mobility indicates\n            having had a significant influence over the evolution of Sri Lanka's infant mortality,\n            maternal mortality and literacy. The general level of education also was found statistically\n            significant over the same three dependent variables representing Sri Lankan quality\n            of life. The significance of the education variable serves to support a large extent\n            of literature that suggests adult education as an influential force in ensuring better\n            physical status and overall well\u2010being. One such example is the study conducted by\n            Caldwell and McDonald in 1982.\n14\nThe health parameter, on the other hand, was found significant only over maternal\n            mortality and literacy. The directionality of the health variable was consistent with\n            regard to the reduction of infant mortality; but its significance as a determinant\n            appeared much below the acceptable levels. The health variable was retained in this\n            model as the overall significance of the model was better with it than without.\nBy standardising the coefficients (Table\n3\n), the study also attempted to understand the relative magnitude of the impact of\n            each of the independent variables on the respective quality of life parameter. These\n            results suggest that affordable mobility services provided by the CTB to the general\n            public has played a dominant role in improving social welfare parameters in Sri Lanka.\n            It is noteworthy that the relative impact of the mobility proxy appeared to have had\n            a greater influence than that of both health and education proxies in determining\n            maternal mortality and literacy. With regard to infant mortality, the education proxy\n            seems to have had the highest impact. In fact, it is only on maternal mortality that\n            the health variable appears to have managed to avoid showing the lowest relative impact;\n            the respective standardised coefficient being marginally higher than that of the education\n            variable.\nTable 3.\nStandardised coefficients.\nPredictor variable\nModel 1\nModel 2\nModel 3\nInfant mortality\nMaternal mortality\nLiteracy\nCTB bus kilometres\n(0.37)\n(0.43)\n0.47\nNurses\n(0.19)\n(0.35)\n0.27\nTeachers\n(0.50)\n(0.32)\n0.37\nCoefficients recorded in parenthesis are negative\nAll standardised coefficients were obtained for the log\u2013log model presented in Table\n2\nA possible explanation for these turnouts may be the relatively longer lagged effect\n            of the health variable in influencing the quality of life parameters. Life expectancy\n            at birth, for instance, would take a long time to adjust through welfare\u2010oriented\n            investment on relatively younger generations, while its influence over already aged\n            population, whose age at death would be a determinant of the current life expectancy\n            level, is likely to be marginal. This is because their life patterns, health conditions\n            and other such critical factors, would not be significantly influenced at the latter\n            ages of their lives. In the case of maternal mortality, the health variable dominating\n            over the education variable could be understood. But, the health variable being overpowered\n            by the mobility parameter suggests the importance of accessing the hospital, even\n            more than healthcare itself. On the other hand, the health variable not emerging as\n            a statistically significant determinant in the infant mortality model could be owing\n            to the possibility of the parameter being influenced by an intrinsic type of factors\n            such as the tolerance level or genetic characteristics of the infant and its inherent\n            vulnerability to external factors\n26\n.\nThe findings of this research therefore suggest that the efforts of providing affordable\n            mobility to the general public under the CTB have been successful. The nationalisation\n            of the bus industry in 1958 was mooted on the ground that the bus services in the\n            pre\u2010nationalisation era were essentially profit\u2010seeking and therefore operated only\n            on routes productive for the bus owners (some of them were parliamentarians) while\n            largely neglecting the welfare axis\n21\n. The systematisation of the bus operations, expansion of the service supply and network\n            coverage and providing bus services for masses at affordable fares, were realised\n            under the CTB\n22\n. These efforts, according to the results of the present research, appear to have\n            successfully enabled poor masses the required affordable mobility to accede welfare\n            services, thus significantly contributing towards the quality of life of Sri Lankan\n            people during the 1960s and 1970s. These findings also support the hypothesis\n22\nthat the high\u2010quality affordable mobility ensured through public bus transport services\n            during this period was instrumental in Sri Lanka's remarkable achievement, at the\n            same time, of maintaining a low rate of rural to urban migration.\n6 Conclusion\nThis research, in an effort to quantitatively examine the impetus of public transportation\n            towards greater social sustainability, has come out with suggestive evidence for the\n            presence of a strong relationship between the evolution of quality of life parameters\n            and \u2018affordable mobility\u2019 provided to masses in developing countries. It serves the\n            purpose of not only understanding the role of public transportation in the lives of\n            people in Sri Lanka from the 1960s through to the 1980s but also to understand why\n            other developing countries would possibly have failed in their state\u2010run welfare service\n            provision efforts in bringing up the quality of life indices of their societies.\nThe fact that \u2018affordable mobility\u2019 of people is found a significant determinant of\n            quality of life in the Sri Lankan socio\u2010economic evolution possibly demonstrates how\n            developing countries could achieve a high social standing in spite of low per capita\n            incomes and a high percentage of widely spread rural settlements. Even if free healthcare\n            and education service provision facilities are established around a country, the public,\n            and particularly the poor masses living largely in the rural hinterlands, have to\n            rely on some sort of transportation to travel to the small regional centres where\n            such hospitals and schools are located, if they are to be \u2018included\u2019 as beneficiaries\n            of such services. The low levels of income earned by the masses would not permit them\n            to possess private modes of motored mobility and thus would have to forego fulfilling\n            their welfare service needs (social exclusion) unless an affordable public transport\n            solution is made available to them. A widespread bus transport provision, such as\n            what was provided by the CTB in Sri Lanka, would therefore be necessary in developing\n            nations if those are to ensure social inclusivity that is widely recognised as an\n            imperative for effective transformation of state\u2010run welfare services including healthcare\n            and education into an improved social quality of life of their people.\nHowever, it is also necessary that such public transportation services be regulated\n            and affordable. The success of attaining better accessibility in Sri Lanka is also\n            due to the CTB being a state\u2010owned enterprise that had welfare motives rather than\n            making profit and thus widely extended its route network all over the country, including\n            its deep hinterlands when and where the road infrastructure permits operation of a\n            bus. This welfare aspect in mobility is important for at least two purposes, namely\n            the affordability and the dependability, both being essential requirements to ensure\n            inclusivity of the poor rural masses. However, this could be threatened if public\n            transportation was unregulated and left to be fully driven by the market forces. That\n            could explain why the welfare objective, particularly the affordability of fare levels,\n            was always a policy concern, even after liberalisation of the bus services and the\n            introduction of bus operations by the private sector. The government always paid policy\n            attention to provide socially important bus services such as operations on uneconomic\n            routes, night and off\u2010peak services and school services, with a minimum service level\n            and at affordable fare levels. It was achieved through the state\u2010owned bus operation\n            (the restructured successors of the CTB) as the service provider and as the market\n            leader and also through regulatory means and incentive schemes administered over the\n            private bus sector. This continued provision of affordable mobility to needy segments\n            would have persistently supported the welfare development process of Sri Lanka even\n            beyond the study period of this research, in spite of the gradually reduced relative\n            importance of bus services over the years with increasing income levels, which made\n            privately owned mobility means, particularly two and three wheelers, affordable to\n            the public.\nIt is also important to recognise the peculiarities of Sri Lanka in relation to its\n            geographical and climatic setting \u2013 being a small island, the transportation needs\n            also are proportional to its geographical boundaries, and the tropical weather conditions\n            are never too severe. Therefore, the country could even afford to proceed towards\n            achieving social inclusivity to at least a certain extent through non\u2010motorised means\n            and \u2018track\u2010road based\u2019 small scale rural infrastructure development, the solutions\n            attempted by other developing countries as cited in literature. But, not all developing\n            countries can relate to this advantage: especially those in the African continent\n            and parts of Asia, with their extreme weather conditions, vast country sizes and difficult\n            geographical settings. Therefore, the need for an appropriate motorable public mobility\n            solution at affordable costs is pressing in such countries.\nThe findings of this research also have the potential of throwing light on an alternative\n            perspective to the common problem of \u2018economic and external cost effectiveness\u2019 in\n            pursuing social inclusivity, prevalent in the developing world. On the one hand, it\n            contributes to address the policy dilemma of improving the quality of life of marginalised\n            groups in society and pockets of communities in rural hinterlands, by appraising the\n            concept of \u2018bringing the needy people to services\u2019 against the alternative of \u2018bringing\n            services to people\u2019; decision is likely to be governed by the comparative economies\n            of scale. On the other hand, the public transport option the findings of the study\n            support tends to induce researchers and policy makers to investigate the possibility\n            of public transport becoming a solution to emerging social problems such as providing\n            mobility to fast ageing population, narrowing the empowerment gaps in different segments\n            of the society and addressing the regional disparities. Such might require a holistic\n            regard on public transport provision, looking at it beyond a mere rent seeking \u2018enterprise\u2019,\n            and the lessons learnt from the Sri Lankan experience could potentially constitute\n            an example.\nOn a futuristic note, despite the recognition of mobility as a mandatory requirement\n            for development in economics literature, little thought appears to be given to the\n            importance of such mobility being \u2018environment friendly\u2019. Building upon the findings\n            of this study, the lessons learnt could also be applied to the today's dilemma faced\n            by the developing countries in their attempt to manage mobility demand under increasing\n            income levels and increasing affordability of privately owned vehicles and in sustaining\n            their economic and social development while maintaining at least a minimum acceptable\n            level of environmental quality. As public transport modes are much more economical\n            and less polluting than any form of private vehicle (the most \u2018combustion efficient\u2019\n            car, e.g. would be more fuel consuming and pollution intensive per passenger kilometre\n            than the least efficient traina is only likely to be addressed through a well\u2010planned\n            \u2018\nPublic Transport First\n\u2019 model.\n7 List of Abbreviations\nCTB\nCeylon Transport Board\nOLS\nOrdinary Least Squares\nGDP\nGross Domestic Product\nGNP\nGross National Product\nPQLI\nPhysical Quality of Life Index\nUNESCO\nUnited Nations Organisation for Education, Science and Culture\n1\nHowever, this might not be the best short term option for developing nations with\n               large rural populations, as the infrastructure and the skills to use such technological\n               tools are not widespread.\n2\nThe Physical Quality of Life Index was built by Professor Morris David Morris in the\n               1970s and took into account the changes in quality of life of people in countries\n               (or in regions) as against the then common norm of ranking countries in income classes.\n               This indicator took into account (i) infant mortality rates, (ii) maternal life expectancy\n               and (iii) literacy rates of countries and ranked them in a 0\u2013100 point scale.\n3\n(Anand & Kanbur 1987;\n27\n; Anand & Ravallion, Human Development in Poor Countries: On the Role of Private Incomes\n               and Public Service\n13\n-\n15\n)\n4\nIsenman\n8\n, stated that Sri Lanka's superior social development was not only the result of government\n               intervention in providing welfare services but also was due to initial conditions\n               such as its Buddhist heritage. It is also plausible that Buddhist ideas such as giving,\n               sharing and compassion have shaped the creation of the welfare state and the Sinhalese\n               Buddhist majority made the sustenance of the welfare provisions effective\n18\n.\n5\nDheerasinghe\n20\nrecorded that a large number of routes operated by the CTB were commercially unremunerative,\n               and that only the inter\u2010urban routes were profitable, while almost all rural routes\n               were uneconomical to operate. In this, it is implicit that a large number of routes\n               operated by the CTB have been rural. Mitchell\n19\nhighlights the expansion of CTB's bus operations between 1968 and 1978 in spite of\n               the financial losses. Accordingly, the bus kilometres operated increased by 33% resulting\n               in a 59% growth of passenger kilometres. Thus, it could be inferred that rural population\n               in Sri Lanka largely benefitted from the mobility services provided by the CTB.\n6\nThe affordability of the masses in the aftermath of independence was minimal, and\n               private modes of transportation were never considered an option. Also, the CTB was\n               the only operator of public bus services during this period.\n7\nBy the nationalisation, there had been 71 privately owned companies in Sri Lanka operating\n               bus services\n28\n, but no statistics were available on their service provision.\n8\nThe data are courtesy of Kumarage, Amal, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka\n9\nThe role of the midwife and the nurse was significant in the rural areas than in the\n               urban areas of Sri Lanka during the period under consideration. Unlike in other countries,\n               the role of the midwife was not to assist the mothers to have their babies at their\n               homes but to promote having babies in hospitals (under formal medical care) by way\n               of personally accompanying the mothers to the nearest hospital. The actual job they\n               did extended up to even staying with the pregnant mothers in the hospital to assist\n               and familiarise them to the hospital environment. Both nurses and midwives had a personal\n               rapport with the patients that ensured more and more people to turn to formal medical\n               institutions to have their children, thereby reducing the number of avoidable infant\n               deaths.\n10\nBesides, number of hospitals as a variable depicted a \u2018structural break\u2019, which could\n               not be accounted for in the literature.\n11\nThe quality of education provision cannot be represented by mere numbers of schools\n               or teachers, but with something more representative of the qualitative aspects. According\n               to the United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture (UNESCO) (systematic\n               monitoring of education for all) pupil teacher ratio is one of the best indicators\n               of the quality of education, which also serves as a quantifiable measure. However,\n               this ratio is not available for the present study owing to the absence of a sufficiently\n               long series of data.\n12\nIn the 1960S and 1970, health and education services in Sri Lanka were provided free\n               of charge, and public bus transport provision (particularly rural services) was heavily\n               subsidised.\n13\nWignaraja\n25\n, for instance, while admitting that with 15 observations and six variables there\n               would only be 9 degrees of freedom, still performed the analysis as there was no way\n               of sourcing a longer data array.\n14\nUsing Nigerian data, it was found that a parent's level of education was a stronger\n               determinant of reducing infant mortality than income and access to healthcare put\n               together.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

Although some encouraging results have been demonstrated with smoking cessation\n                  interventions targeted to cancer patients, few empirical studies of such interventions\n                  have been conducted.

More research\n                  is needed to empirically test cessation interventions for cancer patients, and attention\n                  must be given to complex and unique issues when tailoring cessation treatment to these\n                  individuals. Cancer 2006. \u00a9 2005 American Cancer Society.\nAlthough most smoking cessation efforts have been aimed at primary prevention of cancer,\n            the importance of stopping smoking for individuals diagnosed with, being treated for,\n            and surviving cancer must not be overlooked. A growing body of evidence indicates\n            that continued smoking after a diagnosis of cancer has substantial adverse effects\n            on treatment effectiveness, overall survival, risk of second primary malignancy, and\n            quality of life.\n1\n-\n3\nThese adverse effects are found both in patients with smoking\u2010related cancers and\n            in those with nonsmoking\u2010related cancers. However, the diagnosis of cancer is underused\n            as a teachable moment to encourage smoking cessation among patients, family members,\n            and significant others. The medical, psychosocial, and general health benefits of\n            smoking cessation for cancer patients provide a clear rationale for intervention.\n            Moreover, patient knowledge of these benefits may increase motivation to stop smoking\n            and help those who quit to remain abstinent. Two prominent behavioral intervention\n            models based on providing personalized information to increase motivation to quit\u2014The\n            Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change) and Motivational Interviewing\u2014have demonstrated\n            the effectiveness of such methods.\n4\n,\n5\nResearch indicates that after cancer diagnosis, motivation for and interest in smoking\n            cessation are greatly increased, particularly in patients with cancers strongly related\n            to smoking, such as head and neck and lung cancer.\n6\n-\n8\nThus, after a patient is diagnosed with cancer, a window of opportunity opens during\n            which healthcare providers can intervene and assist in the quitting process. This\n            window of opportunity remains open throughout treatment and into the period of cancer\n            survivorship, because up to one\u2010third to one\u2010half of cancer patients either continue\n            to smoke after diagnosis or relapse after initial quit attempts, depending on tumor\n            site and duration of follow\u2010up.\n6\n,\n8\n-\n13\nIn this article, we have provided an overview of the benefits of smoking cessation\n            in cancer patients and the current state of knowledge concerning clinical practice\n            guidelines and empirically supported smoking cessation interventions. We have included\n            clinical case histories of cancer patients to illustrate challenges to smoking cessation.\nImportance of Smoking Cessation on Cancer Treatment Outcome\nImpact of smoking and smoking cessation on cancer treatment effectiveness\nFor the major cancer treatment modalities\u2014radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery\u2014smoking\n               has been found to diminish treatment effectiveness, exacerbate side effects, and interfere\n               with wound healing. Moreover, smoking is a risk factor for a wide range of pulmonary,\n               cardiovascular, infectious, and wound\u2010related complications.\n14\nLower rates of complete response to radiation therapy have been reported for patients\n               who continue smoking compared with nonsmokers or smokers who quit before treatment.\n15\nOral mucositis, loss of taste, xerostomia, weight loss, and fatigue are all exacerbated\n               by continued smoking.\n1\nBecause smoking increases the hepatic metabolism of many drugs, continued smoking\n               may decrease the therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapy and many other medications\n               used to treat cancer patients.\n16\nSmoking\u2010related complications can be significantly reduced when patients stop smoking\n               at least 4 weeks before surgery, primarily postsurgical pulmonary complications.\n14\n,\n16\n,\n17\nIn addition, smoking cessation is strongly advised for patients undergoing surgical\n               treatment because continued smoking increases the risk of wound infection and has\n               detrimental effects on wound healing.\n18\nFor example, current smokers undergoing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous\n               (TRAM) flap procedures for breast reconstruction have an increased risk of flap necrosis,\n               abdominal flap necrosis, and hernia.\n19\nIt is recommended that breast reconstruction either be delayed or conducted with\n               caution in patients who smoke. Chang and colleagues found no differences in complication\n               rates between former smokers and nonsmokers when using the TRAM free flap procedure.\n19\nIn general, reconstructive surgeons usually consider a case successful if a patient\n               stops smoking 4 weeks before surgery, remains abstinent postoperatively, and has healed\n               wounds.\n20\n,\n21\nImpact of smoking and smoking cessation on survival rates\nThe detrimental effect of smoking on cancer survival rates has been consistently demonstrated.\n               Continued smoking after diagnosis has been found to negatively affect overall survival\n               in patients with lung,\n22\n,\n23\nhead and neck,\n15\nprostate,\n24\nand cervical cancers.\n25\nHowever, stopping smoking before diagnosis and treatment can have a positive influence\n               on survival rates. Studies have generally indicated that the longer the interval between\n               smoking cessation and initiation of cancer treatment, the better the prognosis. Browman\n               and colleagues\n15\nfound that compared with head and neck cancer patients who continued to smoke after\n               diagnosis, patients who quit smoking within 12 weeks before diagnosis had a mortality\n               risk reduction of 40%, and those who quit smoking more than 1 year before diagnosis\n               had an even larger mortality risk reduction of 70%. Although a more recent study by\n               these investigators failed to detect an independent effect of continued smoking on\n               survival rates, it did support an adverse effect of smoking at diagnosis on both overall\n               and cancer survival.\n26\nOther findings among head and neck cancer patients indicate that after 2 years, the\n               survival of patients who had quit smoking after diagnosis approached that of patients\n               who had never smoked.\n27\nOther studies have documented an adverse prognostic impact of smoking history on survival.\n               In one study, head and neck cancer patients with any history of smoking (former or\n               current) were found to have not only lower rates of survival but also lower rates\n               of disease\u2010specific survival and recurrence\u2010free survival compared with patients who\n               had never smoked.\n28\nIn a study of patients with Stage I nonsmall\u2010cell lung cancer, Fujisawa and colleagues\n29\nfound a significantly higher overall survival rate at 10 years for patients reporting\n               less than 30 pack\u2010years of cigarette smoking (83.0%) than for patients with a history\n               of more than 30 pack\u2010years (36.7%).\nImpact of smoking and smoking cessation on risk of second primary malignancy\nContinued smoking is known to increase the risk of developing a second primary malignancy\n               at both the initial tumor site and other sites. Although evidence suggests a dose\u2013response\n               relation between cumulative tobacco use and development of second primary tumors,\n               continued exposure to tobacco after diagnosis appears to be a more important risk\n               factor.\n30\nMultiple studies have found that patients who continue smoking after diagnosis have\n               an increased risk of developing a second primary malignancy.\n31\n-\n34\nAdditional evidence suggests that individuals who successfully quit smoking after\n               lung cancer diagnosis can significantly decrease their risk of second primary tumors\n               compared with those who continue to smoke.\n33\n,\n35\nImpact of smoking cessation on quality of life\nAnother important class of health outcomes that should be considered is quality of\n               life (QOL). Whereas disease and treatment\u2010related variables can clearly influence\n               the QOL of cancer patients, cigarette smoking is another important variable to consider.\n               Gritz and colleagues prospectively investigated QOL outcomes in patients with head\n               and neck cancer, who at baseline either were current smokers or had quit within the\n               previous 12 months. Patients who were former smokers by 1\u2010year follow\u2010up reported\n               higher QOL than patients who had not stopped smoking.\n36\nDuffy and colleagues\n9\nalso examined smoking behavior in head and neck cancer survivors and found that current\n               smokers had significantly poorer physical functioning, general health perceptions,\n               vitality, social functioning, and emotional functioning compared with nonsmokers.\n9\nIn a more recent study,\n11\ncontinued smoking after lung cancer diagnosis was associated with lower QOL. In particular,\n               persistent smokers demonstrated significantly poorer QOL outcomes compared with never\n               smokers, and intermediate levels of QOL were found for former smokers as well as those\n               who quit between diagnosis and subsequent evaluation. Although findings from these\n               studies need to be replicated, the negative association between smoking and QOL is\n               in agreement with associations observed in general populations and other patient populations.\n               These associations indicate that nonsmokers have higher QOL than do current smokers,\n               former smokers have higher QOL than do current smokers, and QOL decreases as smoking\n               intensity (number of cigarettes per day) increases.\n37\n-\n41\nSmoking Cessation Treatment for Cancer Patients\nVery few smoking cessation interventions have been empirically tested with cancer\n               patients. Limited research suggests that many of the factors that influence cessation\n               in cancer patients are similar to those seen in the general population (e.g., nicotine\n               dependence, readiness to quit, age).\n6\nEven though cessation interventions should be tailored to the unique needs of cancer\n               patients (see below), treatment must be informed by evidence from smoking cessation\n               studies in the general population and other patient groups.\nClinical practice guideline\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service has produced\n                  a clinical practice guideline, based on a systematic review and analysis of scientific\n                  literature, containing a series of recommendations and strategies to assist healthcare\n                  providers in delivering smoking cessation treatment.\n42\nThis guideline emphasizes the importance of systematic identification of tobacco\n                  users by healthcare workers and of offering at least brief treatment to every patient\n                  who uses tobacco. Specific strategies to guide clinicians in providing brief interventions\n                  are offered and include: 1) identifying and documenting tobacco use for every patient\n                  at every visit, 2) strongly urging every tobacco user to quit, 3) determining the\n                  willingness of the tobacco user to make a quit attempt, 4) using counseling and pharmacotherapy\n                  to aid patients in quitting, and 5) scheduling follow\u2010up contact. These are referred\n                  to as the 5 As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange).\n42\nThe Clinical Practice Guideline summarizes effective smoking cessation treatments\n                  and the benefits of combining treatment modalities.\n42\nTechniques drawn from behaviorally based counseling models\u2014including motivational\n                  enhancement,\n43\nproblems solving, and skills training\u2014are empirically supported for smoking cessation.\n                  Additional counseling components found to be highly effective include the provision\n                  of social support and assistance in securing social support outside of treatment.\n                  First\u2010line pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation include both nicotine replacement\n                  therapy (i.e., nicotine patch, gum, inhaler, spray, and lozenge) and the sustained\u2010release\n                  antidepressant bupropion (Zyban, GlaxoSmithKline plc, London, UK), which have been\n                  shown to approximately double cessation rates.\n42\nTailoring of cessation treatment for cancer patients\nUnique disease\u2010related issues need to be taken into account when implementing smoking\n                  cessation interventions with cancer patients. Smoking\u2010cessation strategies may need\n                  to be modified because of physical limitations imposed by disease and treatment. For\n                  example, it may be important to offer specially tailored suggestions regarding exercise\n                  regimens and dietary change, which are often informal components of smoking cessation\n                  programs. Medical contraindications to certain types of nicotine replacement therapy\n                  must also be recognized and appropriately managed. Thus, while pharmacological treatment\n                  is recommended for all patients as a component of smoking cessation intervention,\n                  individuals with oral cancers may be unable to use oral forms of nicotine replacement\n                  such as the gum, spray, inhaler, or lozenge. In such cases, the nicotine patch or\n                  bupropion may be the most appropriate alternative treatment. It is also important\n                  to be sensitive to stressors faced by patients and associated psychological issues\n                  and mood disorders such as guilt, depression, and anxiety, all of which may impede\n                  smoking cessation efforts. Patients will be particularly sensitive to any perceived\n                  blame for their illness, especially when the disease is smoking\u2010related. Instead,\n                  the healthcare provider should explain the strong role of nicotine addiction and facilitate\n                  motivation for behavioral change using the social support of family, friends, and\n                  healthcare professionals. In a sample of lung cancer patients, Walker et. al.\n13\nprovided some noteworthy preliminary findings on how patients' \u201creactance\u201d, or receptivity\n                  to advice and direction, may serve as a guide to offering directive advice and support.\n                  For example, patients who are more adherent, in general, may benefit from more directive\n                  advice and support, whereas more resistant and nonadherent patients may do better\n                  with less directive advice and support. This is certainly an area for additional research.\nAs quit rates have been reported to be higher for patients with cancers strongly related\n                  to smoking,\n6\n,\n7\nit is likely that awareness of the connection between diagnosis and smoking status\n                  facilitates smoking cessation. Healthcare providers play a crucial role in underscoring\n                  this link. Education on the health risks of continuing to smoke after diagnosis, regardless\n                  of cancer type, and the health benefits of smoking cessation may be particularly useful\n                  in increasing motivation and interest in quitting.\nHelping patients to sustain smoking cessation poses another unique challenge in working\n                  with cancer patients. Although relapses in healthy persons usually occur within the\n                  first week after cessation, relapses in cancer patients are often delayed because\n                  of surgical and other posttreatment healing. Gritz, et al. reported that among head\n                  and neck cancer patients who relapsed to smoking after quitting successfully, the\n                  majority of relapses did not occur until 1\u20136 months after surgery.\n44\nThis delay in relapse may signal a waning motivation for abstinence as patients recover\n                  physically and return to their prediagnosis lifestyle. Thus, interventions to prevent\n                  relapse and promote sustained abstinence are particularly important as patients heal.\nEmpirically tested cessation interventions with cancer patients\nSeveral studies examining the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions designed\n                  specifically for cancer patients were conducted within hospital settings and delivered\n                  by nurses. The typical intervention used in these studies consisted of three in\u2010hospital\n                  visits, the provision of educational materials, and five postdischarge telephone calls.\n                  Findings indicated higher abstinence rates in the intervention group than in the usual\u2010care\n                  control group; however, these rates varied greatly from study to study. Across two\n                  studies, abstinence rates at the time of the first postdischarge visit varied between\n                  65\u201375% for the intervention group compared with 43\u201350% for the control group.\n45\n,\n46\nWewers and colleagues\n47\nreported abstinence rates of 40% at 6\u2010week follow\u2010up for lung cancer patients using\n                  this same intervention in a single group design. In the most recent study conducted\n                  with cancer patients by these investigators, the abstinence rate in the intervention\n                  group was only 21%, compared with 14% in the usual\u2010care condition at 6 weeks postintervention.\n48\nHowever, a more modest treatment was used with only one in\u2010hospital nurse visit,\n                  provision of educational materials, and five postdischarge telephone calls. It was\n                  concluded that a more intensive intervention might be needed.\nA randomized, controlled trial of a surgeon\u2013dentist\u2010delivered intervention for patients\n                  with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract was conducted\n                  by Gritz and colleagues.\n6\n,\n10\n,\n36\nIn this study, both intervention\u2010 and control\u2010group patients received personalized\n                  risk factor information and strong advice to quit smoking from their surgeon or maxillofacial\n                  prosthodontist. Although the intervention group's quit rates were not significantly\n                  increased by the addition of signed quitting contracts, tailored booklets, reminder\n                  postcards, and booster sessions at follow\u2010up medical visits, the high quit rates for\n                  all participants (70.2% continuous abstinence at 1\u2010year follow\u2010up) suggests that brief\n                  advice, given in the context of medical care, is a powerful tool. In another study\n                  of physician\u2010delivered advice, the potential need for more intensive treatment for\n                  some cancer patients was demonstrated by Schnoll and colleagues.\n49\nIn this study, cancer patients with various diagnoses were randomly assigned to usual\n                  care with unstructured smoking\u2010cessation advice or a physician\u2010delivered smoking intervention\n                  based on National Institutes of Health guidelines. No differences in cessation rates\n                  were found between the groups at the 6\u2010 or 12\u2010month follow\u2010up, ranging from 12% to\n                  14%. The higher quit rates found by Gritz and colleagues are likely explained by the\n                  targeting of patients with a smoking\u2010related cancer (i.e., head and neck cancer) by\n                  their direct treatment providers.\nAdditional studies have compared outcomes between cancer patients and other participants\n                  in general smoking cessation programs conducted at the Mayo Clinic Nicotine Dependence\n                  Center, which offered a range of treatments over time. A matched\u2010pair design was used\n                  to retrospectively analyze abstinence rates at 6\u2010month follow\u2010up for patients with\n                  certain types of cancer compared with the general patient population. Sanderson Cox\n                  and colleagues\n50\nreported that lung cancer patients were significantly more likely to achieve 6\u2010month\n                  tobacco abstinence than controls (other cancer patients and noncancer patients), 22%\n                  versus 14%. However, in another Mayo Clinic study, Garces et al.\n51\nfound no significant differences in abstinence rates between head and neck cancer\n                  patients (33%) and controls (26%). Both studies found that duration of time between\n                  cancer diagnosis and smoking cessation treatment significantly affected tobacco use\n                  outcome. Significantly higher abstinence rates were found for both lung and head and\n                  neck cancer patients treated within 3 months of diagnosis compared with those treated\n                  more than 3 months after diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of early treatment\n                  after diagnosis.\nCase histories: the need for intensive smoking cessation interventions for cancer\n                  patients\nCancer patients who continue to smoke after physician\u2010delivered advice or other brief\n                  cessation interventions are likely to require intensive interventions that combine\n                  multiple treatment modalities. The first three cases of the five presented below illustrate\n                  the detrimental effects of continued smoking on cancer treatment outcomes and difficulties\n                  that cancer patients face in quitting smoking and remaining abstinent.\nCase 1.\nThis 52\u2010year\u2010old woman was diagnosed with a Stage II infiltrating ductal carcinoma\n                     of her right breast. At the time of diagnosis, the patient was divorced with no known\n                     psychiatric history. She endorsed rare alcohol use and no drug use. She had a history\n                     of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), intermittent bronchitis, and pneumonia.\n                     She started smoking at age 16 years, and other than stopping for about 4 years many\n                     years ago, she smoked between 1 and 2.5 packs per day until diagnosis. Between diagnosis\n                     and treatment, her smoking decreased to one cigarette per day, and she was noted to\n                     be taking bupropion to assist with smoking cessation.\nThe patient underwent a right modified radical mastectomy, followed by chemotherapy\n                     and radiation therapy. Later, she developed recurrent upper respiratory infections\n                     and pneumonia. She indicated that she was smoking about a half pack of cigarettes\n                     per day. After repeated attempts at quitting with subsequent relapse, the patient\n                     enrolled in a smoking cessation clinic. She was treated with behavioral counseling,\n                     nicotine patches, and bupropion. She reportedly remained abstinent for 5 months, and\n                     then she underwent a delayed right breast reconstruction with a TRAM pedicle flap.\n                     Her postoperative course was complicated by fat necrosis in the right breast and in\n                     some of the skin at the TRAM donor site. The patient admitted that she resumed smoking\n                     (1\u20132 cigarettes per day) upon discharge from the hospital. The patient was repeatedly\n                     advised by her surgeon that continued smoking would have a deleterious effect on her\n                     healing and prolong her recovery. The patient continued to intermittently endorse\n                     and deny occasional smoking.\nShe then underwent debridement of the tissue at the abdominal donor site and the part\n                     of the TRAM flap comprising the upper half of her right breast. Later, the abdominal\n                     donor site was closed with a skin graft. The patient was informed that complete smoking\n                     cessation was required before any surgery could be performed to complete the reconstruction\n                     of her right breast and revise the donor site scar. She was referred to a smoking\n                     cessation clinic where she received counseling and bupropion treatment. Approximately\n                     10 months after the skin graft procedure, she stated that she had remained abstinent\n                     from smoking for several weeks. To verify her compliance with smoking cessation, a\n                     urine specimen was obtained; the urine cotinine was negative for nicotine use.\nShe underwent a revision of her right breast with a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous\n                     flap and revision of the TRAM donor site. A left prophylactic mastectomy was performed\n                     at the same time as this procedure. A urine cotinine level was obtained during the\n                     surgical procedure and was positive for nicotine use postoperatively. The patient\n                     continued to deny smoking. She suffered wound healing problems involving skin edge\n                     necrosis on the back, which eventually resolved. The patient underwent the next stage\n                     of reconstructive surgery about 4 months later. She tolerated this surgery well and\n                     had no smoking\u2010related complications.\nCase 2.\nThis 44\u2010year\u2010old married woman was diagnosed with a large squamous cell carcinoma\n                     of the left cheek. The patient admitted to smoking approximately a half pack of cigarettes\n                     a day for the last 21 years. She denied alcohol or illicit drug use. The tumor was\n                     widely excised, and the resulting large cheek defect was closed with a large local\n                     skin flap. At discharge, the flap was noted to be viable; however by the 10\nth\npostoperative day, the distal one\u2010third of the flap had become necrotic. Although\n                     the patient had reported discontinuing tobacco use before surgery, she resumed smoking\n                     soon after discharge.\nThe necrotic cheek skin was surgically debrided, and the wound closed with a full\u2010thickness\n                     skin graft. The skin graft survived transplantation, but the thinness of the graft\n                     resulted in a significant contour deformity. Unfortunately, the patient became significantly\n                     depressed because of facial disfigurement, an outcome that she ascribed to the reconstructive\n                     surgeon. The patient further reported increasing marital discord about her physical\n                     appearance and the lack of family support for smoking cessation. She requested a second\n                     opinion to remove the skin graft and correct the deformity. Another plastic surgeon\n                     evaluated the patient and felt that that surgical correction was possible if the patient\n                     could quit smoking and her depression was adequately treated. The patient was referred\n                     to the psychiatry service and smoking cessation clinic, and additional surgery to\n                     correct the deformity was postponed until she could abstain from smoking for at least\n                     1 month before the surgical intervention.\nIn smoking cessation clinic, the patient reported continuing to smoke approximately\n                     3\u20134 cigarettes per day. She was initially prescribed bupropion and a 7 mg starting\n                     dose of nicotine replacement patches. She was educated about components of nicotine\n                     addiction, learned problem\u2010solving techniques, and was scheduled for additional counseling\n                     sessions. The patient subsequently elected to start a 21 mg dose of nicotine replacement\n                     that had been previously made available to her. This led to alterations in her treatment\n                     course, as extended time was needed to gradually reduce the nicotine levels in the\n                     patches. She attended only one follow\u2010up session in the smoking cessation clinic.\nTwo months later, the patient stated that she had abstained from smoking and using\n                     nicotine patches for 3 continuous weeks. Several weeks later, she underwent subcutaneous\n                     placement of tissue expanders on the left side of her face, neck, and upper chest\n                     wall region. However, the patient's preoperative cotinine level was later found to\n                     be positive for nicotine, indicating she had either continued to smoke or was using\n                     nicotine replacement treatment before surgery. During the next clinic visit, the test\n                     results were presented to the patient, but she continued to deny smoking and refused\n                     to provide a urine specimen for a cotinine level to verify compliance with smoking\n                     cessation. The following week, she willingly provided a urine sample; however, she\n                     became tearful and confessed that she had been smoking about four cigarettes a day\n                     when asked to also provide a saliva sample for a cotinine level during the same visit.\n                     The patient obtained a psychiatric evaluation. She endorsed symptoms of chronic low\n                     mood for the past 2\u20133 years, low self\u2010esteem, and significant feelings of guilt about\n                     continuing to smoke. She was diagnosed with dysthymia with anxious features, prescribed\n                     antidepressant medication, and subsequently engaged in individual therapy sessions.\nUltimately, infection led to exposure of the tissue expanders, and they had to be\n                     removed. The neck skin was advanced without tension to remove some of the skin graft.\n                     Postoperatively, the patient continued to smoke cigarettes despite the surgeon's warnings\n                     of continued difficulty with wound healing. The last known clinical contact that addressed\n                     the patient's smoking status indicated that she had not yet abstained from smoking.\n                     Moreover, her spouse was not supportive of her efforts at smoking cessation and continued\n                     to smoke in front of her.\nDiscussion of cases.\nIn the two cases presented above, the harmful impact of nicotine addiction was manifested\n                     in delayed and failed reconstructive procedures at psychologically sensitive and value\u2010laden\n                     body sites\u2014the breast and the face. Although surgical complications related to skin\n                     and fat necrosis cannot be entirely eliminated with smoking cessation, continued smoking\n                     undoubtedly increases the risks of such adverse effects.\n18\n,\n52\nBoth patients had long histories of moderate to heavy smoking and alleged periods\n                     of intermittent smoking reduction or abstinence. Treatment for nicotine dependence\n                     in these patients was complicated by repeated relapses to smoking (\nCase 1\n), depressive symptoms and seemingly inadequate social support (\nCase 2\n). In both cases, physicians took an active role in promoting smoking cessation, advised\n                     on the risks of continued smoking, and delayed nonessential surgical procedures until\n                     smoking cessation could be achieved. Unfortunately, in\nCase 2\n, the patient was unable to be truthful about her continued smoking. The surgeon requested\n                     biologic samples for confirmation of abstinence on repeated visits to provide the\n                     optimal medical care. This led to a psychiatric referral and appropriate evaluation\n                     and treatment for the patient's mood disorder.\nIn cases such as these, simultaneous, multiple approaches may be necessary. Consultation\n                     with smoking cessation specialists is vital for these patients. Treatment strategies\n                     should be guided by a thorough assessment of tobacco use, which includes examining\n                     current level of motivation to quit and remain abstinent. It is recommended that smoking\n                     behaviors continue to be evaluated (and biochemically verified) by the treating physician\n                     at each follow\u2010up visit. For patients such as the woman described in\nCase 1\n, particular emphasis should be given to providing an intervention that focuses on\n                     relapse prevention. In addition to counseling and behavioral strategies to promote\n                     relapse prevention, it is recommended that smoking behaviors continue to be evaluated\n                     by the treating physician at each follow\u2010up visit. This will allow patients to discuss\n                     any difficulties with quitting (e.g., craving, withdrawal symptoms, depression, medication\n                     side effects, and high\u2010risk situations for relapse) and facilitate prompt encouragement\n                     and support for resuming cessation in the event of a relapse to smoking.\nIn both cases described above, higher doses of nicotine replacement therapy over longer\n                     treatment periods, concomitant with pharmacologic treatment of depression, should\n                     be considered. For patients such as the woman described in\nCase 2\n, thorough assessment and treatment of depression and other mood disorders is likely\n                     to be critical to successful treatment. Moreover,\nCase 2\nhighlights the importance of attending to and understanding the patient's existing\n                     social network. Behavioral strategies to improve social skills and facilitate effective\n                     communication with spouses, family members, or other significant figures in the patient's\n                     life are recommended. Systemic interventions to actively involve family members should\n                     also be considered. In this way, the patient can be made a full partner in the therapeutic\n                     alliance against nicotine addiction, not its failed victim.\nCase 3.\nThis 64\u2010year\u2010old man was diagnosed with a large squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.\n                     Before diagnosis, the patient had smoked 3 packs per day for 40 years. The patient\n                     is married and has no known psychiatric history or history of illicit substance or\n                     alcohol abuse. The patient reported that he reduced his cigarette consumption to a\n                     half pack per day after diagnosis. He was initially treated with chemotherapy and\n                     radiation. At the advice of his healthcare provider, the patient engaged in smoking\n                     cessation treatment, which consisted of behavioral and pharmacologic interventions.\n                     He subsequently relapsed to smoking and did not return for additional counseling sessions.\nWithin 1 year, the patient was diagnosed with an adenocarcinoma of the lower right\n                     lobe of the lung. Surgery was delayed until the patient could abstain from smoking\n                     to minimize his chances of perioperative pneumonia. Approximately 1 month later, the\n                     patient underwent a right lower lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection to\n                     remove the tumor. He resumed smoking after surgery, and approximately 3 months later\n                     was noted to have chronic nicotine and reflux changes to his larynx. The patient had\n                     intermittent contact with a smoking cessation counselor, but he was noted to continue\n                     smoking approximately a half pack per day.\nOne year later the patient reported persistent cough, frontal headaches, and chronic\n                     postthoracotomy pain. He subsequently enrolled in a Southwest Oncology Group (S0002)\n                     smoking cessation trial during which he received: behavioral advice delivered by healthcare\n                     providers; pharmacotherapy including the use of nicotine replacement patches and randomization\n                     to bupropion or placebo; targeted written materials (Public Health Service\u2010based tip\n                     sheets, etc.); and 5 follow\u2010up telephone calls to reinforce the intervention over\n                     a 10\u2010week interval. This patient was not randomized to the arm of treatment that included\n                     bupropion (i.e., he received placebo.). With this intervention, the patient effectively\n                     established a quit date and abstained from smoking for 3 weeks. After the onset of\n                     general feelings of ill health and the development of an upper respiratory tract infection,\n                     the patient stopped adhering to smoking cessation treatment and relapsed to smoking.\n                     He was unable to set another quit date and eventually declined to continue participating\n                     in the intervention. The patient continued to smoke approximately a half pack of cigarettes\n                     per day. His chest film and computed tomography (CT) scan showed changes consistent\n                     with emphysema. During the following year, repeat CT and positron emission tomography\n                     (PET) scans showed prominent, but stable, paratracheal lymph nodes. The patient is\n                     scheduled for annual follow\u2010up evaluations to monitor the status of these nodes. He\n                     continued to smoke approximately 1 pack per day as of the last clinical contact.\nDiscussion of case.\nFor patients such as the man described in\nCase 3\n\u2014a seriously ill patient with a long\u2010term history of heavy smoking and only limited\n                     periods of smoking reduction and abstinence\u2014the presence of multiple primary cancers,\n                     comorbid disease, and deteriorating health may all contribute to declining motivation\n                     to maintain abstinence and seek further smoking cessation treatment. In such cases,\n                     the complications and symptoms of advanced disease may be mitigated by eliminating\n                     smoking. The 10\u2010week intervention in which this patient participated was not sufficient\n                     to promote long\u2010term smoking cessation. Although the optimal length of intervention\n                     may vary, prolonged pharmacologic treatment with both nicotine replacement and an\n                     antidepressant as well as sustained guidance from healthcare providers regarding problem\u2010solving\n                     and skills training are indicated. Psychological issues including guilt, depression,\n                     anxiety, and stress should also be considered and managed appropriately. Intensive\n                     psychological support, including a family conference, may be helpful, because such\n                     patients may also benefit from involvement of spouses and other important members\n                     of their social network in their treatment. It is particularly important to assess\n                     whether these patients live with individuals who smoke, as this can represent a significant\n                     barrier to smoking cessation (as in\nCase 2\n).\nExamples of successful smoking cessation treatment\nIn the final two clinical cases, the healthcare provider's active role in promoting\n                  smoking cessation led to positive outcomes.\nCase 4.\nThis 54\u2010year\u2010old woman was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ in both breasts.\n                     She is married, with no alcohol or drug use and no known psychiatric history. She\n                     had a history of smoking at least a half pack per day, but she had quit for the past\n                     7 years. One month before her diagnosis, the patient resumed smoking 5\u20136 cigarettes\n                     daily. Subsequently, she underwent wide excision of the left breast tumor and segmental\n                     mastectomy of the right breast. Although the margins of resection were negative for\n                     tumor in the left breast, residual disease was found at the deep margin of the right\n                     breast.\nBecause she had carcinoma in situ in both breasts and a significant family history\n                     of breast cancer, she was advised to undergo a modified radical mastectomy and immediate\n                     reconstruction of both breasts. During the consultation with the plastic surgeon,\n                     she admitted to continued smoking. The patient was considered to be an appropriate\n                     candidate for a TRAM free flap breast reconstruction provided she stopped smoking\n                     as soon as possible and remained abstinent before and after surgery. The plastic surgeon\n                     fully discussed the increased risks for necrosis of the breast skin, the skin and\n                     fat of the TRAM flap, and its donor site because of inadequate perfusion of blood\n                     through these tissues if she continued to smoke. The patient reportedly took the advice\n                     of the surgeon and stopped smoking.\nApproximately 3 weeks later, she underwent a skin\u2010sparing mastectomy and immediate\n                     reconstruction of both breasts with a TRAM free flap. Six months after surgery, the\n                     patient was evaluated for the next stage of breast reconstruction, involving a revision\n                     of the reconstructed breasts and bilateral nipple reconstruction. From the initial\n                     consulting visit with the plastic surgeon through all stages of breast reconstruction,\n                     the patient remained abstinent from smoking and did not suffer a major complication.\nCase 5.\nThis 63\u2010year\u2010old woman presented with a squamous cell carcinoma of the floor\u2010of\u2010mouth\n                     and was evaluated for possible reconstruction after tumor resection. She is married,\n                     does not drink alcohol, and has no history of psychiatric disorder. The patient had\n                     smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes a day for 40 years and had never attempted to quit.\n                     She was seen by a smoking cessation specialist and started on buspirone, an antianxiety\n                     agent that has been used with some success in smoking cessation treatment. The patient\n                     was informed that she must stop smoking, preferably the day of the consultation. She\n                     was seen again 1 and 2 weeks later; she had markedly decreased her smoking to 2 cigarettes\n                     a day, but she did not totally quit until her surgery.\nThe patient underwent composite tumor resection and immediate reconstruction of the\n                     missing mandible, floor\u2010of\u2010mouth, and part of the oral tongue with a fibula osteocutaneous\n                     free flap. The patient's hospital course was without problems. On the 6\nth\npostoperative week, she began radiation therapy and experienced no significant complications\n                     during recovery. The smoking cessation specialist contacted her family by telephone\n                     3 months after surgery and learned that she was not requesting nor discussing smoking\n                     again. She has been able to abstain from tobacco and nicotine use for 5.5 years.\nThe patient developed lung cancer 3.5 years after her head and neck diagnosis. She\n                     was treated by resection of the upper lobe of the right lung, along with three ribs\n                     and the transverse processes of the 3\nrd\nand 4\nth\nvertebrae. However, she recuperated successfully from this treatment and is alive\n                     and free of disease.\nDiscussion of cases\nThe two successful smoking cessation cases illustrate several salient points. Patients\n                  who are lighter smokers, have a long history of past successful quitting, and a relatively\n                  short relapse period (\nCase 4\n) are excellent candidates for resuming abstinence. Their self\u2010esteem regarding quitting\n                  is likely high, and they can draw upon past experience to deal with temptation, count\n                  upon family support, as well as benefit from the strong and targeted advice of the\n                  treating physician. In the example of a heavy smoker with no history of cessation\n                  (\nCase 5\n), the astute evaluation by a smoking cessation specialist with the prescription of\n                  appropriate pharmacotherapy and follow\u2010up sufficed to support a successful quit effort.\n                  Interestingly, although this patient developed a second primary tumor, she was curatively\n                  treated for it, maintained abstinence from cigarettes, and has not suffered further\n                  disease. It is very possible that her successful abstinence has contributed to her\n                  long\u2010term recovery.\nSummary and Recommendations\nThe importance of smoking cessation for all cancer patients, regardless of whether\n               the primary tumor is smoking\u2010related, has been clearly demonstrated. It is strongly\n               urged that patients who continue to smoke after diagnosis be identified and that smoking\n               cessation interventions tailored to these patients be made more readily available.\n               Patients and caregivers would benefit from learning about the adverse effects of continued\n               smoking on cancer treatment effectiveness, wound healing, treatment side effects,\n               survival rates, risk of secondary malignancies, and overall QOL.\nA range of intervention components, drawn from extensive research on smoking cessation\n               in the general population and in other patient groups, is readily applicable to cancer\n               patients. Although more research is clearly needed to empirically test smoking cessation\n               interventions with cancer patients, encouraging results have been demonstrated with\n               brief physician\u2010delivered advice and nurse\u2010delivered hospital cessation programs.\n               More intensive interventions, combining elements of behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy,\n               have been developed for cancer patients but have not yet been extensively tested.\nPracticing oncologists would benefit from obtaining knowledge of the appropriateness\n               of interventions and the importance of prioritizing cessation along with other treatment\n               adjuvants. At the initial consultation session, it is strongly recommended that physicians\n               inquire about and document a patient's smoking history, current smoking status, and\n               willingness to make a quit attempt (if applicable). The primary elements of smoking\n               history to obtain include current smoking status, number of cigarettes smoked daily,\n               age at which smoking began, number of years smoked, cessation history, other forms\n               of tobacco use, degree of addiction, and readiness to quit. In addition, smoking behaviors\n               should be routinely evaluated and documented at each follow\u2010up visit. For patients\n               who have a recent smoking history, consideration should be given to the use of biochemical\n               verification of smoking status (e.g., expired carbon monoxide levels or urine, saliva,\n               or serum cotinine levels). This practice not only would allow physicians to have more\n               accurate data with which to guide complicated treatment decisions (e.g., those related\n               to surgery and radiation therapy) but also may facilitate a more candid discussion\n               of motivational factors and individual barriers to quitting.\nWe offer several recommendations for future research regarding smoking cessation treatment\n               for cancer patients. With one exception,\n49\nintervention studies for cancer patients have focused solely on individuals with\n               smoking\u2010related cancers. Future studies need to include patients with nonsmoking\u2010related\n               cancers. Future studies should also investigate the benefits of targeting interventions\n               on the basis of cancer site because of potential differences between smoking\u2010related\n               and nonsmoking\u2010related tumors. Research is ongoing to identify specific genes associated\n               with nicotine dependence, response to treatment, and cancer susceptibility.\n53\n-\n56\nFor example, the identification of a lung cancer susceptibility gene may allow intensive\n               early intervention and tailoring of risk messages to healthy individuals being screened\n               for lung cancer and to lung cancer patients at risk for second primary tumors. In\n               addition, the identification of genes associated with nicotine dependence and/or treatment\n               response may allow tailoring of pharmacologic treatment, both type and dose, to cancer\n               patients on the basis of genotype. Needless to say, even in the absence of genetic\n               information, all patients who smoke, who are at elevated risk, or who are already\n               diagnosed with cancer should be offered smoking cessation treatment.\nFurther studies should be conducted to determine individual barriers to smoking cessation\n               among cancer patients. Risk perceptions and cognitive beliefs about smoking have been\n               extensively studied in the general population but are not fully understood in cancer\n               patients. Previous studies have generally indicated that smokers tend to minimize\n               the personal health risks of smoking or have incomplete knowledge, particularly of\n               potential disability.\n57\n-\n59\nSeveral self\u2010exempting beliefs have been identified in adult smokers that are used\n               to rationalize smoking behavior and that predict intention to quit smoking.\n60\nImportant differences in smoking cognitions may exist between smokers in the general\n               population and those diagnosed with cancer, and between smokers diagnosed with smoking\u2010related\n               cancers and those diagnosed with nonsmoking\u2010related cancers. A recent survey of survivors\n               of nonsmoking\u2010related cancers (breast and prostate) and colorectal cancer, which is\n               weakly related to smoking, reported a high level of inaccurate belief (75\u201381% of respondents)\n               that tobacco was an important cause of all three cancers, plus a relative overemphasis\n               on stress (44\u201368%) and environmental pollution (58\u201378%). Other behavioral and lifestyle\n               factors, including drinking alcohol, diet, obesity, and physical inactivity were generally\n               endorsed at lower rates.\n61\nSuch identification of smoking\u2010related beliefs among cancer patients, as well as\n               dispositional variables that affect treatment adherence,\n13\ncould be used to further tailor smoking cessation interventions for this population.\nSmoking cessation interventions for cancer patients can be further improved by using\n               standardized assessment tools and sound methodology drawn from smoking cessation literature\n               on healthy populations. It is important to recognize the range of outcomes for these\n               patients as they relate to disease and functional status as well as to overall QOL.\n               The inclusion of adequate follow\u2010up periods (at least 1 yr) is also necessary to assess\n               the duration of effects and to provide data comparable to those available from healthy\u2010population\n               studies.\nCancer patients who are able to stop smoking and remain abstinent after diagnosis\n               and treatment are likely to reap substantial physical and psychological benefits,\n               including improved QOL and prolonged survival. Additional benefits may extend to family\n               members who choose to act on this teachable moment to improve their own health and\n               provide vital psychological and social support through their actions.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

Our\n         objective was to investigate if symptom control in bronchial asthma could be in conflict\n         with general quality of life. We made a follow\u2010up study of 152 patients (105 male,\n         47 female) over the age of 30 (31\u201355\u2003yr) who were allergic asthmatics in childhood.\n         The patients\u2019 current symptoms and short\u2010term quality of life were evaluated by a\n         questionnaire. The patients developed asthmatic symptoms by age 4.4 (0.5\u201313) years\n         on the average. Now 60% (91 persons) have no symptoms. They became symptom\u2010free between\n         3 and 41\u2003yr of age (mean\u2003=\u200314.2\u2003\u00b1\u20038.2). Amongst the currently asthmatic patients (58\n         patients, 38%), 34 patients (22%) belong to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)\n         I, nine patients (6%) to the GINA II, five patients (3.3%) to the GINA III, and five\n         patients (3.3%) to the GINA IV classification. Five patients (3.3%) did not specify\n         their own symptoms. Three persons (2%) did not answer this question. Symptomatic patients\n         reached 5.28 on the Juniper Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, while their asymptomatic\n         peers scored statistically higher with 6.8 on the scale. Amongst the symptomatic patients,\n         the most limited areas were: \u2018bothered by heavy breathing\u2019, \u2018had to avoid a situation\n         or environment because of dust\u2019, \u2018experienced difficulty breathing out as a result\n         of asthma\u2019, \u2018experienced asthma symptoms as a result of the weather or air pollution\n         outside\u2019. They were least \u2018concerned about medication\u2019, \u2018frustrated as a result of\n         their asthma\u2019, they were least limited in \u2018going outside because of the weather or\n         air pollution\u2019. The most problematic areas for the symptom\u2010free patients were \u2018had\n         to avoid a situation or environment because of dust\u2019, \u2018had to avoid a situation or\n         environment because of cigarette smoke\u2019, \u2018experiencing asthma symptoms as a result\n         of being exposed to dust and the \u2018need to clear throat\u2019. It seems that having no asthma\n         symptoms is not equal to having a good quality of life for asthmatic patients. Moreover,\n         symptom control in bronchial asthma is in conflict with quality of life, as many prophylactic\n         measures to prevent exposure to allergens also restrict the patient's life.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

It was produced by the Standards of Care Committee\n            of the British Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, using accredited methods.\n            Allergic rhinitis is common and affects 10\u201315% of children and 26% of adults in the\n            UK, it affects quality of life, school and work attendance, and is a risk factor for\n            development of asthma. Allergic rhinitis is diagnosed by history and examination,\n            supported by specific allergy tests. Topical nasal corticosteroids are the treatment\n            of choice for moderate to severe disease. Combination therapy with intranasal corticosteroid\n            plus intranasal antihistamine is more effective than either alone and provides second\n            line treatment for those with rhinitis poorly controlled on monotherapy. Immunotherapy\n            is highly effective when the specific allergen is the responsible driver for the symptoms.\n            Treatment of rhinitis is associated with benefits for asthma. Non\u2010allergic rhinitis\n            also is a risk factor for the development of asthma and may be eosinophilic and steroid\u2010responsive\n            or neurogenic and non\u2010 inflammatory. Non\u2010allergic rhinitis may be a presenting complaint\n            for systemic disorders such as granulomatous or eosinophilic polyangiitis, and sarcoidoisis.\n            Infective rhinitis can be caused by viruses, and less commonly by bacteria, fungi\n            and protozoa.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nAllergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR) remains the most common immunological disease in\n            man and is still subject to under\u2010recognition and poor management. This matters because\n            AR significantly reduces quality of life (QOL),\n1\ninterferes with both attendance and performance at school and work\n2\n,\n3\nand results in substantial societal costs.\n4\nIn addition, as the nose is the gateway to the respiratory tract, rhinitis is associated\n            with symptoms in the eyes,\n5\nsinuses,\n6\nmiddle ear,\n7\nthe nasopharynx and lower airways.\n8\nBoth AR and non\u2010allergic rhinitis (NAR) are risk factors for the development of asthma.\n9\nRhinitis impairs asthma control\n10\n,\n11\nand increases its costs.\n11\nAll patients presenting with nasal symptoms require accurate diagnosis and appropriate\n            treatment. These guidelines are intended to facilitate this.\nEvidence for the recommendations was obtained using electronic literature searches\n            using the primary keyword\u2014rhinitis. Further searches were carried out by combining\n            this search term with key words listed above through MEDLINE and EMBASE from 2007\n            to 2014.\nAdditional references were hand searched and provided by committee members, experts\n            and reviewers from 2014 to 2017. Recent advances since the 2007 guidelines include\n            evidence for local allergic rhinitis, demonstration of the greater effectiveness than\n            either alone of combined topical preparations of antihistamine and corticosteroids,\n            the concept of rhinitis control and of severe chronic upper airways disease (SCUAD)\n            and better evidence for the efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy. Each article was\n            reviewed according to criteria for suitability for inclusion. Recommendations were\n            evidence graded, see Appendix\nA1\n.\n12\n,\n13\nDuring guideline development, a web\u2010based system was used to allow consultation with\n            all BSACI members. The draft guidelines were amended by the Standards of Care Committee\n            (SOCC) after careful consideration of all comments and suggestions. Where evidence\n            was lacking, a consensus was reached among the experts on the committee. Conflicts\n            of SOCC members\u2019 interests were recorded.\nThe draft was reviewed by a lay person.\n2 DEFINITIONS/CLASSIFICATION\nRhinitis describes inflammation of the nasal mucosa but is clinically defined by symptoms\n            of nasal discharge, itching, sneezing and nasal blockage or congestion. When the conjunctivae\n            are also involved, the term rhinoconjunctivitis is more accurate. Involvement of the\n            sinus linings in more widespread disease is known as rhinosinusitis. Rhinitis has\n            multiple phenotypes, usually divided into allergic, non\u2010allergic and infective as\n            well as mixed forms.\n2.1 Classification of Allergic Rhinitis (AR)\nThe WHO ARIA workshop \u201cAllergic Rhinitis and its impact on Asthma\u201d classification\n14\nof AR based on frequency and severity of symptoms has been validated.\n15\nAdditionally clinical classification into seasonal and perennial rhinitis is useful\n               in UK practice for diagnosis and allergen\u2010specific therapy.\n2.2 Infective rhinitis\nAny cause of congestion of the nasal mucosa can lead to occlusion of the sinus ostia,\n               predisposing to acute rhinosinusitis and/or Eustachian tube dysfunction.\n2.3 Non\u2010allergic rhinitis (NAR)\nThe numerous diagnoses in this category need to be borne in mind for patients with\n               negative skin prick tests (SPTs).

Large scale\n            genome\u2010wide association studies (GWAS) have allowed identification of several candidate\n            loci and genes for asthma and atopic dermatitis.\n56\n-\n59\nTo date, only one such GWAS has been carried out for AR.\n60\nOf note, classical genetic change (i.e change in DNA nucleotide sequence) is unable\n            to account for the rapid increase in prevalence of AR seen in recent years, suggesting\n            environmental factors (and possible gene\u2010environment interactions) are important.\n            Epidemiological evidence suggests smaller family size, urban environments and reduced\n            exposure to infectious diseases is involved and appear to have a particular effect\n            during early life.\n61\n-\n64\nEpigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may be involved in the mechanism\n            of gene\u2010environment interactions in allergic diseases.\n65\n5 ALLERGIC RHINITIS\n5.1 Pathophysiology\nThe basic mechanisms of AR are illustrated in Figure\n1\n.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nImmunological mechanisms of Allergic Rhinitis. Sensitized patients with allergic rhinitis\n                        have IgE antibodies for specific allergen(s) bound to receptors on the surface of\n                        mast cells. On re\u2010exposure to the specific allergen(s), cross\u2010linking of adjacent\n                        IgE molecules occurs, and mast cell degranulation results. Pre\u2010formed mediators such\n                        as histamine stimulate sensory nerve endings within seconds, causing itch and sneezing,\n                        and promote dilatation of local vasculature and glandular secretion, causing obstruction\n                        and rhinorrhoea, respectively.

The mechanism of the association between asthma and rhinitis is\n                        uncertain, but the tendency for asthma to succeed rhinitis, the demonstration that\n                        nasal allergen challenge in AR gives lower respiratory tract inflammation and the\n                        prevention of progression of AR to asthma by allergen immunotherapy suggest that the\n                        asthma is consequential in individuals in whom rhinitis is the initial manifestation\n                        of atopic disease.\nAR\u2010associated comorbid disorders can be subdivided into:\nother allergic diseases, particularly asthma\nproblems related anatomically to the nose: conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, hyposmia,\n                     middle ear problems, throat and laryngeal effects\nSleep problems and secondary effects of symptoms on concentration, mood and behaviour\nThe most important co\u2010morbidity is asthma: not only is rhinitis a risk factor for\n               subsequent asthma but 80% of asthma sufferers according to ARIA have concomitant rhinitis,\n               poor control of which is a risk factor for asthma exacerbations.\n10\n,\n11\n,\n103\n,\n104\n,\n106\n6 NON\u2010ALLERGIC RHINITIS (NAR)\nThis group consists of patients with symptoms of rhinitis but without any identifiable\n            allergic triggers. It is a diagnosis of exclusion in patients negative for systemic\n            IgE, when the many other causes of rhinitis have been ruled out (Table\n1\n). The inaccurate term, vasomotor rhinitis should no longer be used. Infective rhinitis\n            is not considered in this guideline.\n6.1 Pathophysiology\nAt least two subgroups exist: one with nasal inflammation on histology,\n107\nthe other without inflammation or local IgE production.\n108\nThe former includes local allergic rhinitis\n109\nand non\u2010allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia (NARES). A proportion of patients within\n               this latter group are aspirin/NSAID sensitive.\n110\nThere is evidence that some patients with apparently non\u2010allergic rhinitis share\n               similar histologic mucosal features as those with allergic rhinitis characterized\n               by increased numbers of mast cells and eosinophils and produce local IgE,\n107\n,\n111\n,\n112\nPatients with non\u2010inflammatory type rhinitis are thought to suffer from dysfunction\n               of the autonomic nerve supply to the nasal mucosa.\n67\n,\n113\n6.2 Occupational rhinitis\nOccupational rhinitis, which can be allergic or non\u2010allergic, describes abnormalities\n               of the nasal mucosa mediated by airborne substances in the work environment. It is\n               distinct from work\u2010exacerbated rhinitis, which refers to individuals with pre\u2010existing\n               rhinitis who experience an exacerbation of symptoms due to workplace exposures. Over\n               300 agents can cause occupational rhinitis, and these are the same as those which\n               can induce occupational asthma.\n114\nHMW agents are protein allergens derived from plants or animals, for example, flour,\n               latex, laboratory animals and evidence of sensitization are usually seen on skin testing\n               or serum\u2010specific IgE.\n115\nLMW agents cause mucosal inflammation either via airway immune sensitization, (e.g\n               di\u2010isocyanates and glutaraldehyde) or via irritant exposures (e.g chlorine and ammonia).\n               Occupational rhinitis is three times more frequent than occupational asthma; the two\n               conditions frequently occur together.\n116\n,\n117\nThe early identification of a causative occupational agent and the avoidance of exposure\n               are important for the prevention of progression to occupational asthma\n118\n-\n121\n(Grade B).\nDiagnosis is based on a detailed history, including symptom diary review, improvement\n               of nasal symptoms during weekends and holidays, skin prick testing and measurement\n               of specific IgE when appropriate.\nLatex is a cause of both occupational rhinitis and asthma. Prevention of latex allergy\n               by removing powdered gloves or substituting non\u2010latex ones is essential. All healthcare\n               environments should have a latex policy\n119\n,\n122\n(Level of evidence=2+ and 4; Grade of recommendation=D, C for adults and children\n               with perennial rhinitis or adults and children with latex allergy).\n7 DIAGNOSIS OF RHINITIS\n7.1 History\nA detailed history is required, including seasonality (pollen, moulds), indoors/outdoors\n               location (dust mite, the presence of house pets), work location (occupational), improvement\n               of holidays and, relationship to potential triggers which can impact on the patient's\n               quality of life. Symptoms of sneezing, nasal itching, itching of the palate are more\n               likely to lead to allergic rhinitis.\n7.2 Rhinorrhoea\nRhinorrhoea is either anterior, posterior or both.\nClear\u2014infection unlikely if continuously clear, although secretions are clear early\n                     in viral rhinitis\nUnilateral\u2014is uncommon and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak should be excluded\n123\nColoured\nyellow\u2014allergy or infection; green\u2014usually infection; blood tinged\nunilateral\u2014tumour, foreign body, nose picking or misapplication of nasal spray\nbilateral\u2014misapplication of nasal spray, granulomatous disorder, bleeding diathesis,\n                           infection, nose picking.\n7.3 Nasal obstruction\nCan be partial or complete; severity often correlates with systemic manifestations\nBilateral\u2014most likely rhinitis or nasal polyps but maybe septal (sigmoid) deviation\nUnilateral\u2014usually septal deviation but also consider foreign body, antrochoanal polyp\n                     and tumours\nAlternating\u2014due to rhinitis exposing the nasal cycle\n124\n7.4 Nasal crusting\nSevere crusting especially high inside the nose is an unusual symptom in rhinitis\n               and requires further investigation. Consider: chronic rhinosinusitis,\n125\nnose picking, granulomatous polyangiitis, sarcoidosis or other vasculitides, (particularly\n               if crusting is associated with bleeding), cocaine abuse, ozaena (wasting away of the\n               bony ridges and mucous membranes inside the nose), non\u2010invasive ventilation. Topical\n               steroids rarely cause crusting.\n7.5 Eye symptoms\nInclude intense itching, redness and swelling of the white of the eye, watering, Lid\n               swelling and (in severe cases) periorbital oedema, which can be aggravated by eye\n               rubbing.\n7.6 Lower respiratory tract symptoms\nCough, wheeze, shortness of breath\u2014can occur with rhinitis alone since bronchial hyper\u2010reactivity\n                     can be induced by upper airway inflammation.\n126\n-\n128\nDisorders of the upper and lower respiratory tract often coexist:\n80% of asthmatics have rhinitis\u2014see section on rhinitis and asthma\n7.7 Other symptoms\nSnoring, sleep problems, repeated sniffing, nasal intonation of the voice\nPollen\u2010food syndrome is triggered by ingestion of cross\u2010reacting antigens in some\n                     fruits, vegetables and nuts\n129\nA proportion of patients suffering from allergic (mainly seasonal) rhinitis have an\n                     associated nasal hyper\u2010reactivity which is generally not recognized/treated\n7.8 Family history\nA diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is more likely when rhinitis is seasonal, or with\n               a family history of AR. However, it can arise de novo.\n7.9 Social history\nConsider pets or other contact with animals, occupation or schooling.\n7.10 Drugs\nA number of drugs can cause or aggravate rhinitis symptoms, and therefore, a drug\n               history should include details of the use of alpha\u2010 and beta\u2010blockers and other anti\u2010hypertensives,\n               aspirin and other non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives as well\n               as topical sympathomimetics (see Table\n1\n). It is also important to enquire about the efficacy of previous treatments for rhinitis\n               and details of how they were used and for how long.\n8 EXAMINATION\n8.1 Visual assessment\nAllergic salute and/or horizontal nasal crease across dorsum of nose and/or eye involvement\n                     supports a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis\nChronic mouth breathing\nAllergic shiners\nAn assessment of nasal airflow\u2014(e.g metal spatula misting in young children)\nDepressed nasal bridge\u2014post surgery, granulomatous polyangiitis or cocaine misuse\nWidened bridge; polyps (see also BSACI guideline on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis\n130\n;\nPurple nasal tip due to sarcoidosis\n8.2 Anterior rhinoscopy\nHypertrophic, pale and boggy inferior or middle turbinates suggest inflammation, but\n                     nasal appearance may be normal in AR\nThe presence or absence of clear, coloured or purulent secretions\nA deviated septum does not usually cause rhinitis\nThe presence or absence of nasal polyps, but it may not be possible to see small ones\n                     or if they are confined to the sinuses. Larger polyps can be seen in the nasal vestibule\n                     sometimes extending as low as the nares and can be distinguished from the inferior\n                     turbinate by their lack of sensitivity, yellow/grey colour and the ability to get\n                     between them and the side wall of the nose.\nYellow submucosal nodules with a cobblestone appearance suggest sarcoidosis.\n131\nCrusting and granulations raise the possibility of vasculitis\nSeptal perforation may occur after septal surgery or due to chronic vasoconstriction\n                     (cocaine, alpha agonists), granulomatous polyangiitis, anti\u2010phospholipid antibody\n                     syndrome and nose picking\nThroat examination\u2010cobblestoned lymphoid hyperplasia, post\u2010nasal drip\n8.3 Nasal endoscopy\nUsed in specialist centres to examine both the anterior and posterior\u00a0parts of the\n               nasal cavity this is more specific than rhinoscopy and alters the diagnosis in up\n               to a fifth of patients with nasal disease.\n132\n9 INVESTIGATIONS\nAllergen\u2010specific IgE can be detected with skin prick tests (SPTs) or by serum immunoassay.\n9.1 Skin prick tests (SPT)\nShould be carried out routinely to determine if the rhinitis is allergic or non\u2010allergic,\n                     and have a high negative predictive value.\u00a0They should be interpreted in the light\n                     of the clinical history\nAt least 15% of people with a positive skin prick test do not develop symptoms on\n                     exposure to the relevant allergen\n133\nPrick to Prick tests with fresh food can be used to diagnose oral allergy syndrome\n9.2 Serum total and specific IgE\nSerum\u2010specific IgE may be requested when skin tests are not possible or when the SPT\n               together with the clinical history give equivocal results. Total IgE alone can be\n               misleading but may aid interpretation of specific IgE. Currently available SPTs and\n               allergen\u2010specific IgE show similar sensitivity for house dust mite (HDM), but SPTs\n               are more sensitive to other inhalant allergens such as cat epithelium, mould and grass\n               pollen.\n134\n9.3 Laboratory investigations\nUsually unnecessary, their use is guided by the history, examination and results of\n               skin prick tests. Examples include:\nFull blood count (FBC) and differential white cell count, C\u2010reactive protein (CRP),\n                     immunoglobulin profile, microbiological examination of sputum and sinus swabs when\n                     chronic infection is suspected\nThyroid function tests in unexplained nasal obstruction\nNasal secretions\u2010asialotransferrin for CSF identification\nUrine toxicology when cocaine abuse is suspected\n9.4 Olfactory tests\nThe University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) is well validated,\n               and can be helpful when there is suspicion of malingering,\n135\nit is accepted for legal cases.\n9.5 Cytology\nThe techniques for obtaining cells for cytology in secretions, lavage, scraping, cotton\n               buds or brushings have not been standardized, nor have the criteria for evaluating\n               cell counts.\n136\nNevertheless the presence of eosinophils implies inflammation\u00a0and may be helpful in\n               predicting response to corticosteroids.\n137\n,\n138\n9.6 Exhaled nitric oxide (eNO)\nExhaled nitric oxide (FeNO=fractional exhaled nitric oxide) measurement can be useful\n               clinically in the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma. Normal levels are less than\n               20\u00a0ppb, but become elevated in eosinophilic lower respiratory tract inflammation.\n139\n9.7 Nasal NO\nLevels are complex as there are two sources of NO: sinuses and\u00a0nasal epithelium. However,\n               very low levels (<100\u00a0ppb) indicate\u00a0the likelihood of primary ciliary dyskinesia,\n               but can also be\u00a0observed in cystic fibrosis and in sinus obstruction caused by\u00a0large\n               polyps. NO measurements are restricted to specialist centres.\n9.8 Radiology\nRadiology is not routinely recommended for simple rhinitis. However, when rhinosinusitis\n               or nasal polyposis is suspected, especially non\u2010responsive to medical therapy, CT\n               scan is helpful.\n9.9 Nasal challenge\nIt is not routinely available outside specialist centres; there is no standardized\n               methodology and asthmatic reactions can occur. It may be useful to confirm aspirin\n               sensitivity or in occupational allergic rhinitis, where there is discrepancy between\n               history and when there are potentially important occupational implications.\n9.10 Objective measures of nasal airway\nObjective measurements of the nasal airway are not made in routine clinical practice\n               but can be useful when allergen or aspirin challenges are undertaken and may be helpful\n               when septal surgery or turbinate reduction are being contemplated.\n9.11 Tests for asthma\nMeasurements of lung function should be considered in all patients with persistent\n               rhinitis.\n9.12 ENT referral\nPatients with unilateral symptoms, heavily blood stained discharge or pain, require\n               ENT referral. Those with nasal blockage unrelieved by pharmacotherapy or structural\n               abnormalities, such as septal deviation, sufficient to render nasal therapy difficult\n               should be seen by a surgeon.\n10 TREATMENT\n10.1 Allergen avoidance\nAllergen avoidance clearly works in seasonal allergic rhino\u2010conjunctivitis: hayfever\n               sufferers are symptom\u2010free outside the pollen season. For patients with house dust\n               mite\u2010sensitive AR the situation is complicated by the difficulties of reducing exposure\n               to mites in the home. A systematic review of trials of mite allergen avoidance in\n               rhinitis concluded that trials are generally small and of poor methodological quality\n               and meta\u2010analysis could not be performed.\n140\nLarge studies of a combination of strategies to reduce exposure to dust mites have\n               not been conducted but should probably include measures to reduce mites in cars, at\n               school and work (see Figure\n2\n).\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nRhinitis treatment algorithm.

For those who wish to\n               keep pets to which they are sensitized, there is limited information from randomized\n               studies on which to base recommendations\n144\nHEPA filters alone do not seem useful for cat allergic patients with cats.\n145\nCat allergen exposure can be reduced using temperature\u2010controlled laminar airflow\n               treatment,\n145\nand although this treatment has shown to improve asthma\u2010related quality of life,\n               this has not been tested for rhinitis.\n147\n10.3 Saline irrigation\nIsotonic saline irrigation in both adults and children with allergic rhinitis was\n               well tolerated,\n148\ninexpensive, easy to use with no evidence of adverse effect to health with regular\n               use.\n149\n,\n150\nIt has a small beneficial effect in symptom reduction and may reduce the amount of\n               pharmacotherapy needed (Grade B).\n10.4 Carbon dioxide washing\nThe use of a ten second burst of carbon dioxide from a pressurized container into\n               the nasal airway, with the mouth open, reduces all the symptoms of rhinitis within\n               minutes. It is now available over the counter for rescue treatment as Serenz.\n151\n,\n152\n11 PHARMACOTHERAPY\nAllergen and irritant avoidance are difficult, and many rhinitis sufferers continue\n            to have persistent symptoms, the nature of which should help determine the selection\n            of medication. Available treatments and their effects upon individual symptoms are\n            detailed in Table\n4\n. All have Grade A level of recommendation. Following diagnosis and classification\n            according to disease severity, therapy using a stepwise pharmacotherapeutic approach\n            should be undertaken. A combination of treatments is\u00a0often needed for more severe\n            disease, and it is here that the\u00a0option of immunotherapy should also be considered\n            (Figure\n3\n).\nTable 4.\nPharmacotherapy effects on individual rhinitis symptoms (adapted from\n152\n)\nSneezing\nRhinorrhea\nNasal obstruction\nNasal itch\nEye symptoms\nH1\u2010antihistamines\nOral\n++\n++\n+\n+++\n++\nIntranasal\n++\n++\n+\n++\n0\nEye drops\n0\n0\n0\n0\n+++\nCorticosteroids\nIntranasal\n+++\n+++\n++\n++\n++\nChromones\nIntranasal\n+\n+\n+\n+\n0\nEye drops\n0\n0\n0\n0\n++\nDecongestants\nIntranasal\n0\n0\n++++\n0\n0\nOral\n0\n0\n+\n0\n0\nAnti\u2010cholinergics\n0\n++\n0\n0\n0\nAnti\u2010leukotrienes\n0\n+\n++\n0\n++\nIntranasal steroids and Intranasal antihistamine 1\n+++\n+++\n+++\n+++\n+++\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nBioavailability of intranasal corticosteroids.

Antihistamines with an anticholinergic effect are associated\n               with development of dementia.\n173\n11.3.1 Second\u2010generation antihistamines\nTerfenadine and astemizole were implicated in deaths from ventricular fibrillation\n                  via QT interval prolongation.\n174\nEbastine and mizolastine also need to be used with caution in those with cardiac\n                  risk factors,\n175\nbut even cetirizine, desloratadine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine were\n                  possibly associated with cardiac arrhythmias in a single large European pharmacovigilance\n                  study.\n176\nInteraction with other medications is rare other than for mizolastine with certain\n                  anti\u2010arrhythmics, antibiotics and beta\u2010blockers leading to an increased risk of arrhythmia.\n                  Rupatadine should not be coprescribed with known CYP3A4 inhibitors.\n177\n11.4 Place in therapy\nFirst\u2010line therapy for mild=to\u2010moderate intermittent and mild persistent rhinitis\nAddition to intranasal steroids for moderate/severe persistent rhinitis uncontrolled\n                     on topical intranasal corticosteroids alone, particularly when eye symptoms are present.\n178\n-\n180\nEvidence for this combination is less good than for the addition of intranasal antihistamine\n                     to topical intranasal corticosteroids in a guinea\u2010pig model.\n181\n11.5 Topical H1\u2010antihistamines\n11.5.1 Nasal\nThese are superior to oral antihistamines in attenuating rhinitis symptoms,\n182\nand in decreasing nasal obstruction,\n183\n,\n184\nalthough they do not improve symptoms due to histamine at other sites, such as skin.\n                  There is a rapid onset of action (15\u00a0minutes), faster than oral antihistamines,\n185\nthus, the drug can be used on demand as rescue therapy for symptom breakthrough.\n                  Continuous treatment is, however, more clinically effective than on demand use.\n186\nThey can be effective in patients who have previously failed oral antihistamines.\n187\nTreatment with both an intranasal and oral antihistamine confers no additional advantage\n                  in alleviating nasal symptoms.\n187\nThey are less effective than an intranasal steroid in relieving the symptoms of allergic\n                  rhinitis.\n188\nAdverse effects include local nasal irritation and taste disturbance with Azelastine\n                  (dysgeusia). Azelastine nasal spray is the only available intranasal antihistamine\n                  in the UK.\n11.5.2 Place in therapy\nThis is the first line of therapy for mild\u2010to\u2010moderate intermittent and mild persistent\n                  rhinitis.\nIntranasal steroids used for moderate/severe persistent rhinitis which are not controlled\n                  on topical intranasal corticosteroids alone.\n12 CORTICOSTEROID THERAPY\n12.1 Intranasal corticosteroids (INS)\nTopical corticosteroids are the mainstay of anti\u2010inflammatory intervention in AR.\n               Factors which need consideration are systemic drug bioavailability, safety and cost.\n189\nEase of device use may influence concordance. INS reduces all symptoms of rhinitis\n               by about 17% more than placebo, with a variable effect on associated allergic conjunctivitis.\n190\n,\n191\nMeta\u2010analysis shows that INS is superior to oral antihistamines or leukotriene receptor\n               antagonist alone on all aspects of allergic rhinitis\n155\n,\n192\n(Grade Ia).\nUnlike other treatments, INS reduce nasal congestion.\n192\nOnset of action is 6\u20108\u00a0hours after the first dose, clinical improvement may not be\n               apparent for a few days and maximal effect may not be apparent until after two weeks.\n192\nStarting treatment two weeks prior to a known allergen season improves efficacy.\n193\nSimilar clinical efficacy for all INS, but bioavailability varies considerably (see\n               Figure\n3\n).\nSystemic absorption negligible with mometasone furoate, fluticasone furoate and fluticasone\n               propionate and these preparations are favoured for children. Systemic absorption is\n               modest for the remainder, and high for betamethasone which should be used short\u2010term\n               only.\n194\n,\n195\n12.2 Adverse events\nLocal nasal irritation, sore throat and epistaxis affect around 10% of users. Benzalkonium\n               chloride is used as a preservative in several topical corticosteroids, and may irritate\n               the nose, but does not adversely affect mucociliary clearance.\n196\nIn patients with nasal irritation symptoms such as burning, for example, a trial\n               with a benzalkonium free preparation, for example rhinocort, flixonase nasules are\n               suggested. Reduction of local adverse effects such as nasal crusting, bleeding and\n               pain can be achieved in many cases by correct use of the intranasal device, see Figure\n4\na; (Grade of recommendation=D). Nasal drops are useful for severe obstruction and\n               should be used in the \u201chead upside down\u201d position to reach the ostiomeatal complex\n               (OMC), see Figure\n4\nb.\nFigure 4\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\n(A and B) How to use a nasal spray and nasal drops Evidence grade D\nCaption\n(A and B) How to use a nasal spray and nasal drops Evidence grade D\nHypothalamic\u2010pituitary axis suppression may occur when multiple sites are treated\n               with topical corticosteroids in the same person (e.g skin, nose and chest).\n197\nIf corticosteroids are used in multiple sites, then a low bioavailability preparation\n               should be favoured.\nRaised intra\u2010ocular pressure has been described with INS\n198\nthus limiting its use in patients with predisposition to high ocular pressure/glaucoma\n               is important.\n12.3 Place in therapy\nFirst\u2010line therapy for moderate\u2010to\u2010severe persistent symptoms.\n14\nFirst line of therapy if presenting with severe nasal obstruction,\n192\npossibly combined with a short\u2010term nasal decongestant. In severe nasal obstruction\n               steroid drops or oral steroids should be used initially for up to one week. For oral\n               or topical antihistamines in uncontrolled rhinitis\u2014see below.\n13 COMBINATION THERAPY\n13.1 INS and oral preparations\nINS demonstrate similar or greater efficacy to an oral antihistamine plus a leukotriene\n               receptor antagonist\n199\n,\n200\n(see Appendix\nA2\n).\n13.2 INS and topical H1\u2010antihistamine combination\nCurrently available as a combination spray containing azelastine and fluticasone propionate\n               (FP), dymista leads to greater symptom improvement than using either agent alone in\n               SAR (Grade A).\n201\nAll symptoms of allergic rhinitis were significantly improved with onset of action\n               by 30\u00a0minutes.\n202\nThe combination approach leads to clinical improvement of symptoms days earlier than\n               seen with azelastine or FP monotherapy.\n201\nOcular symptoms of allergy were better treated with the combination spray rather\n               than FP or azelastine alone.\n202\nEfficacy over FP is demonstrated in perennial allergic rhinitis.\n203\n13.3 Adverse effects\nThe main side\u2010effect is the bitter taste of azelastine, which is experienced by a\n               small proportion of users.\n13.4 Place in therapy\nCombination of topical AH with INS should be used in patients when symptoms remain\n               uncontrolled on AH or INS monotherapy or on a combination of oral AH plus INS.\n13.5 Systemic glucocorticoids\nThere are no trials of oral steroid use and efficacy in AR, although there is grade\n               A evidence in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis where inflammation is more\n               severe. Use is rarely indicated in the management of allergic rhinitis except for:\n14 SEVERE NASAL OBSTRUCTION\nIn order to obtain control, short\u2010term rescue medication is used during severe exacerbation\n            despite compliance on conventional pharmacotherapy. It is important to ensure intranasal\n            steroid therapy is co\u2010administered alongside oral steroids with or without a short\u2010term\n            decongestant spray to allow intranasal drug penetration (see below). There is no definite\n            consensus on the dose and duration of systemic steroid therapy. A suggested regime\n            for adults is 0.5\u00a0mg per kg for 5\u201010\u00a0days. Oral preparations of steroids as a short\n            course are recommended over depot injectable preparations, which cannot be removed\n            if adverse effects occur. Frequent oral steroid rescue should prompt immunotherapy\n            as a treatment option.\n14.1 Injectable corticosteroids\nInjected preparations are not recommended as compared to other available treatments\n               the risk\u2010benefit profile for intramuscular corticosteroids is poor.\n204\n,\n205\n14.2 Intranasal decongestants\nTopical formulations allow relief of nasal congestion via vasoconstriction within\n               minutes, faster and with greater impact than intranasal steroids.\n206\n,\n207\nA decongestant spray may allow delivery of intranasal drugs beyond the inferior turbinates.\n               For example, oxymetazoline and fluticasone furoate when used together further improved\n               nasal congestion more than either alone.\n207\nThere is no licensed INS plus decongestant combination preparation in the UK at present.\n14.3 Adverse events\nOnly short\u2010term use (generally fewer than 10\u00a0days) is recommended as a paradoxical\n               increase in nasal congestion secondary to rebound vasodilatation (rhinitis medicamentosa)\n               can occur.\n208\nThe risk of this occurrence increases with duration of 3\u20105\u00a0days maximum.\n209\n,\n210\nIntranasal decongestants are less likely to lead to rhinitis medicamentosa when used\n               short\u2010term and alongside an intranasal steroid.\n210\nThey can also cause nasal irritation and may increase rhinitis.\n14.4 Place in therapy\nEustachian tube dysfunction when flying (evidence level D)\nTo increase nasal patency before douching (Grade D) or intranasal administration of\n                     nasal steroids\n211\n14.5 Oral decongestants (pseudoephedrine)\nWeakly effective in reducing nasal obstruction\n212\nand have many side\u2010effects, so are not recommended.\n213\n14.6 Anti\u2010leukotrienes\nThese have a therapeutic profile similar to antihistamines, with efficacy comparable\n               to loratadine in seasonal allergic rhinitis,\n214\nand are less effective than topical nasal corticosteroids.\n214\n-\n217\nThe response is less consistent than that observed with antihistamines.\n217\n-\n219\nLTRAs reduce the mean daily rhinitis symptom scores by 5% more than placebo.\n155\nCombination of anti\u2010leukotriene plus antihistamine has no advantage over either drug\n               used alone\n221\n-\n224\nand is not any more effective than topical corticosteroid alone.\n198\n,\n224\nAnti\u2010leukotrienes may have a place in asthma patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.\n226\n14.7 Adverse events\nThey are usually well tolerated; occasional headache, gastrointestinal symptoms or\n               rashes. Neuropsychiatric manifestations have been reported in children, especially\n               adolescents. There is a possible causal link between LTRA use and eosinophilic polyangiitis.\n227\n,\n228\n14.8 Place in therapy\nMontelukast is licensed in the UK for those with seasonal allergic rhinitis who also\n               have concomitant asthma (UK licence for age > 6\u00a0months; Zafirlukast UK licence>12\u00a0years).\n15 TOPICAL ANTI\u2010CHOLINERGIC\n15.1 Ipratropium bromide\nUsed three times daily it decreases rhinorrhoea (particularly if neurogenic rather\n               than inflammatory origin) but has no effect on other nasal symptoms.\n19\n,\n229\n-\n231\nRegular use may be effective as an \u201cadd\u2010on\u201d for allergic rhinitis when watery rhinorrhoea\n               persists despite topical steroids and antihistamines\n229\n,\n232\n15.2 Adverse events\nDry nose and epistaxis,\n145\nsystemic anti\u2010cholinergic effects are unusual.\n233\n,\n234\nCaution is advised in the elderly in whom periodic revisions of its requirement may\n               have to be instigated.\n15.3 Place in therapy\nPatients with watery rhinorrhoea despite compliance with INS or INS plus antihistamine\n16 CHROMONES (SODIUM CROMOGLYCATE (=CROMOLYN) AND NEDOCROMIL SODIUM)\nSodium cromoglycate and nedocromil sodium inhibit the degranulation of sensitized\n            mast cells, inhibiting the release of mediators.\n235\nSodium cromoglycate is weakly effective in rhinitis with some effect on nasal obstruction.\n236\n,\n237\nThe spray needs to be used several times (3\u20104\u00d7 up to 6\u00d7) per day.\n16.1 Adverse events\nGenerally very well tolerated (including in pregnancy) but these include local irritation,\n               taste disturbance and headache.\n16.2 Place in therapy\nChildren and adults with mild symptoms only and sporadic problems in season or on\n                     limited allergen exposure.\n238\nUseful for individuals unable to take other medications, for example pregnant females.\nCromoglycate and nedocromil eye drops are useful in conjunctivitis as topical therapy.\n236\n,\n239\n17 OCULAR THERAPY\nSunglasses reduce eye symptoms,\n142\nbut as these can occur reflexively secondary to nasal inflammation complete protection\n            is impossible. The ocular manifestations of seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis can often\n            be suppressed by oral antihistamines, usually H1 receptor antagonists, and by intranasal\n            agents, including corticosteroids, antihistamines and combination products. However,\n            they are often better treated using topical eye drops. Mast cell stabilisers such\n            as sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil sodium and lodoxamide are generally effective and\n            safe.\n239\nAntihistamines such as azelastine, emedastine and epinastine may be preferred by\n            some patients.\n240\nA drug with both mast cell stabilising and antihistaminic properties, olopatadine,\n            is often effective and well tolerated, and has the advantage of twice daily application,\n            which particularly suits contact lens wearers. Some patients find that tear supplement\n            drops (\u201cartificial tears\u201d) provide a good measure of symptomatic relief. Topical steroids\n            are effective in suppressing inflammation but can have potentially sight\u2010threatening\n            adverse effects including ocular hypertension/glaucoma, cataract and the enhancement\n            of infection.\nIf indicated, for example vernal conjunctivitis,\n*\nuse should be supervised by an ophthalmologist. Immunotherapy, where indicated, is\n            effective for ocular symptoms.\n18 IMMUNOTHERAPY\nAllergen immunotherapy can improve symptoms, reduce medication requirements and improve\n            quality of life.\n241\n-\n243\n18.1 Subcutaneous injection immunotherapy (SCIT)\nSCIT is effective for both seasonal rhinitis due to pollens (Cochrane meta\u2010analysis\n244\nevidence level 1++) and perennial rhinitis due to house dust mite,\n245\nevidence level 1+). There are few randomized controlled trials of immunotherapy for\n               cat allergy,\n246\n,\n247\n(level 1) SCIT requires weekly up\u2010dosing regimens followed by 4\u20106 weekly maintenance\n               injections for 3\u20105\u00a0yr. Pre\u2010seasonal SCIT is effective for pollen allergy. In view\n               of the risk of systemic side\u2010effects SCIT should only be given in specialist clinics\n               by trained personnel with immediate access to adrenaline and resuscitation facilities.\n248\n18.2 Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT)\nSLIT has emerged as an effective and safe alternative for the treatment of allergic\n               rhinitis with/without seasonal asthma\n242\ndue to grass pollen\n249\n-\n255\nragweed,\n256\n,\n257\nevidence level 1++) and house dust mite(evidence level 1).\n249\n,\n258\nSublingual immunotherapy is well tolerated, with side\u2010effects largely confined to\n               local itching and swelling in the mouth and throat. After supervision of the first\n               dose by the prescribing physician with a one\u2010hour period of observation, SLIT is self\u2010administered\n               daily at home.\nSLIT has an excellent safety record, although there are case reports of systemic reactions\n               and of eosinophilic oesophagitis, but no deaths have been reported. Oral antihistamine\n               given prior to SLIT initiation and for the first two weeks of the course of therapy\n               can reduce local oral irritation (level D).\n18.3 Long\u2010term benefits\nImmunotherapy is the only treatment that can modify the course of allergic rhinitis,\n               with long\u2010term remission following discontinuation.\n259\n-\n261\nSubcutaneous immunotherapy in children with seasonal rhinitis reduces\u00a0progression\n               to asthma, an effect that persisted for 10\u00a0years.\n262\nImmunotherapy may prevent development of new sensitizations.\n263\n,\n264\n18.4 Place in rhinitis therapy\nAllergen immunotherapy within the United Kingdom is recommended in patients with a\n               history of symptoms on allergen exposure and objective confirmation of IgE sensitivity\n               (skin prick test positive and/or elevated allergen\u2010specific IgE) in the following\n               circumstances\n265\n:\nSeasonal pollen induced rhinoconjunctivitis in patients whose symptoms persist despite\n                     maximal drug therapy (combinations of intranasal corticosteroid and antihistamine\n                     taken regularly) (Evidence level 1++, category A). The choice of SCIT or SLIT is based\n                     largely on patient preference as there are no adequately powered head\u2010to\u2010head comparative\n                     trials\nPerennial allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in patients with an allergy to house dust mite\n                     who respond inadequately to anti\u2010allergic drugs and where the allergen is not easily\n                     avoided (e.g veterinary surgeons and public sector workers)\n19 COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES\nThe levels of evidence for all complementary therapies, including acupuncture, herbal\n            medicine, phototherapy and homoeopathy are not considered sufficient for recommendation\n            for clinical use at present.\n20 TREATMENT OF NAR\nEvidence quality from trials is reduced by inadequate patient selection, which is\n            often based solely on negative skin prick tests, without elucidation of NAR phenotypes.\n            A search to identify knowledge gaps and research needs in a database is being undertaken\n            by a working party of the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology\n            and their full report are awaited. Present conclusions, based on a search of literature\n            from 1960 to 2010 and using 40% of 2000 articles, (personal communication), suggests\n            the following:\n20.1 Intranasal ipratropium\nThis is effective for watery rhinorrhoea (level 1b; Bronsky et\u00a0al.\n234\n).\n266\n-\n278\n20.2 Topical capsaicin\nDesensitization reduced symptoms for several months in non\u2010allergic, non\u2010infectious\n               rhinitis, NINAR.\n279\n-\n281\n20.3 Topical corticosteroids\nTopical corticosteroids have an effect in skin prick test\u2010negative rhinitis patients\n               (level 1b), probably on those with underlying inflammation, since studies give variable\n               results,\n282\n-\n286\nand relief was limited in subjects with low levels of nasal eosinophils in a recent\n               study.\n287\n20.4 Topical nasal antihistamines\nAzelastine and olopatadine\n288\n-\n291\n(level 1b) and a combination of azelastine with fluticasone (level 3) reduced symptoms\n               in skin prick test\u2010negative patients over one year.\n203\nDecongestants and oral antihistamines are ineffective.\n20.5 Montelukast\nIt has not been formally trialled in NAR but low quality studies\n224\nsuggest a possible effect in SP\u2010negative patients.\nTRPV1 was considered a prime target for neurogenic rhinitis therapy, but a recent\n               study proved negative when cold dry air challenges were used,\n292\nbut antagonism did reduce the response to capsaicin.\n293\n20.6 Aspirin desensitization\nThis may be effective in those with aspirin\u2014sensitive NAR, but should be preceded\n               by nasal or oral aspirin challenge to establish the diagnosis.\n294\n-\n297\nA suggestion for NAR therapy is given in Figure\n5\n.\nFigure 5\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nTreatment of non\u2010allergic rhinitis. Therapy in NAR depends upon the phenotype. The division into those with and without nasal inflammation\n                        can be made on the basis of nasal smears. Those with inflammation may respond to anti\u2010inflammatory\n                        therapy, although less well than in AR and higher INS doses and combinations of therapy may be needed.

Non\u2010inflammatory NAR may respond to anti\u2010cholinergic therapy or to capsaicin.\n                           Some patients require both anti\u2010inflammatory and anti\u2010neurogenic treatments. (Grade\n                           D evidence)\n21 SURGERY\nSurgery is offered\u00a0in only a\u00a0minority of cases. The indications for surgical intervention\n            are as follows:\nAnatomical variations of the septum with functional relevance.\n298\nDrug\u2010resistant inferior turbinate hypertrophy [Poor objective evidence to support\n                  this indication other than in the short\u2010term].\nThere are no well\u2010conducted (prospective and randomized) studies supporting the use\n            of coblation, laser or surgery to the inferior turbinates in patients with rhinitis\n            which demonstrate benefit, supported by objective measurements, other than in the\n            short\u2010term. Studies of this nature show that surgery to the inferior turbinate does\n            not confer any lasting benefit.\n299\nIf in future trials of surgery are to be done it would seem that, in the first instance,\u00a0they\n            should be limited to patients who have failed to respond to medical treatment given\n            the evidence that is currently available for the benefit that concordant medical treatment\n            provides in the majority of patients.\n22 ASSESSMENT OF RHINITIS CONTROL\nSince 2001, the ARIA patient classification system for allergic rhinitis has been\n            used in both clinical and research settings. It focuses on patient symptoms, their\n            time patterns (either \u201cintermittent\u201d or \u201cpersistent\u201d) and their severity (\u201cmild\u201d vs\n            \u201cmoderate/severe\u201d) and is a simple and quick to administer tool (Figures\n6\n-\n8\n).\nFigure 6\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nRhinitis in children, with permission from EAACI\nCaption\nRhinitis in children, with permission from EAACI\nFigure 7\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nRecognition of rhinitis in children at different ages, with permission from EAACI\nCaption\nRecognition of rhinitis in children at different ages, with permission from EAACI\nFigure 8\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nApproach to therapy for paediatric allergic rhinitis\nCaption\nApproach to therapy for paediatric allergic rhinitis\nIn response to a World Health Organisation endorsed trend, disease control rather\n            than severity is considered a preferable metric to measure and monitor. Three rigorously\n            developed and validated assessments are available (Control of Allergic Rhinitis and\n            Asthma Test (CARAT),\n300\nRhinitis Control Assessment Test (RCAT)\n301\n,\n302\nand Allergic Rhinitis Control Test (ARCT).\n303\nMore recently the simple and quick MACVIA visual analogue scale has been developed.\n304\nTo date, there has been no head\u2010to\u2010head comparison of these tools so it is not possible\n            to rank their utility and validity.\n23 SEVERE CHRONIC UPPER AIRWAY DISEASE (SCUAD)\nSCUAD is a recently adopted term that defines those patients whose symptoms are inadequately\n            controlled despite (i.e guideline directed, safe and acceptable) pharmacological treatment\n            based on guidelines.\n305\nSevere uncontrolled allergic rhinitis, of whatever aetiology, can be classified as\n            SCUAD which affects 18.5% of allergic rhinitis patients. It is important to differentiate\n            between this situation,and those patients who are symptomatic because they are incorrectly\n            treated or have poor adherence. The pathophysiology, genotype\u2010phenotype relationships\n            and natural history of SCUAD are currently poorly understood.\n24 IMPROVING PATIENT ADHERENCE IN RHINITIS\nPoor adherence is a challenge in the management of allergic and non\u2010allergic rhinitis,\n            just as it is in other chronic diseases where generic estimates of non\u2010adherence range\n            from 30 to 60% and from 50 to 80% for preventive measures.\n306\nThere are few very few \u201creal life\u201d studies of adherence in rhinitis to antihistamines\n            and nasal corticosteroids, and there are no data available for adherence with intranasal\n            anti\u2010cholinergics and cromolyn.\n307\nAdherence to specific immunotherapy (SIT) has been documented in greater detail with\n            estimates for compliance with subcutaneous (SCIT) regimes ranging from 33 to 89%,\n            and the reasons for discontinuation being time taken. Sublingual therapy adherence\n            rates range from 44 to 97% initially, but discontinuation rates are high with fewer\n            than 20% of patients progressing to the third year of therapy. The frequency of follow\u2010up\n            visits, perception of poor efficacy and cost contribute to these high rates of attrition.\n307\nUnlike some chronic disorders, there has been little effort expended to date in understanding\n            and improving adherence in\u00a0rhinitis; however, there is evidence to support the importance\n            of:\n24.1 Frequent monitoring visits for SLIT\nPaediatric patients who were reviewed at three monthly intervals were significantly\n               more adherent than those reviewed twice or once a year.\n308\n24.2 Enhanced patient education\nA 3\u2010hour educational programme together with written information\u00a0achieved greater\n               compliance than standard oral instruction.\n309\n25 RHINITIS IN PREGNANCY AND DURING BREASTFEEDING\nRhinitis affects at least 20% of pregnancies\n309\n,\n310\nand can start during any gestational week.\n310\n,\n312\nAlthough the pathogenesis is multifactorial, nasal vascular engorgement and placental\n            growth hormone are likely to be involved.\n312\n,\n313\nRhinitis patients have higher levels of oestrogen and IGF1 during the third trimester.\n            Rhinitis in pregnancy may not be adequately treated during routine antenatal care,\n            and patients benefit from a multidisciplinary approach.\n310\nRhinitis in pregnancy impacts negatively on quality of life, especially during the\n            third trimester and women with pre\u2010existing allergic rhinitis are more severely affected.\n314\nInforming the patient that pregnancy\u2010induced rhinitis is a self\u2010limiting condition\n            is often reassuring. Women developing rhinitis during pregnancy are more likely to\n            deliver female babies,\n315\nand children of mothers developing rhinitis in early pregnancy are more likely to\n            develop rhinitis themselves.\n316\nDuring pregnancy, most medications cross the placenta, and should only be prescribed\n            when the apparent benefit is greater than the risk to the foetus.\n317\nNasal lavage is safe and effective in pregnant women, reducing the need for antihistamines.\n318\nChromones have not shown teratogenic effects in animals and are the safest drug recommended\n            in the first 3\u00a0months of pregnancy, although they require multiple daily administrations.\n            The safety of nasal steroids in pregnancy has not been established through clinical\n            trials. Only minimal amounts of steroid pass into the bloodstream after using a nasal\n            spray and it is good practice to treat with \u201ctried and tested\u201d drugs.\n317\nBeclomethasone, FP and budesonide have good safety records and are widely used in\n            pregnant asthmatic women of these fluticasone has least systemic bioavailability when\n            used nasally.\n319\n-\n321\nThere is considerable clinical experience with chlorphenamine, loratadine and cetirizine\n            in pregnancy, which may be used in addition, but decongestants should be avoided.\n322\n,\n323\nPatients already on immunotherapy may continue if they have already reached the maintenance\n            phase, but each case must be considered individually. The initiation of immunotherapy\n            and up\u2010dosing is contraindicated.\n311\nSimilar recommendations can be made about the treatment of AR during lactation. Nasal\n            lavage is safe to use, whilst breastfeeding. Nasal administration of sodium cromoglycate\n            is not known to have any harmful effects when used by breastfeeding mothers. Antihistamines\n            and nasal steroids should only be used when the clinical imperative outweighs the\n            potential harm to the child. Antihistamines are excreted in breastmilk and, although\n            not known to be harmful, the manufacturers of most antihistamines advise avoidance,\n            whilst breastfeeding. Chlorphenamine may cause drowsiness and poor feeding in the\n            baby. Both loratadine\n324\nand cetirizine appear safer with low levels found in breastmilk.\n325\nThe lowest dose should be used for the shortest duration.\n26 RHINITIS IN CHILDREN\nAcute viral rhinitis is common and usually easy to distinguish. It peaks during the\n            winter. The frequency of episodes varies with age, birth order and degree of day\u2010care\n            exposure. Between 1 and 10 episodes per year is usual, with a peak between 6\u00a0months\n            and 6\u00a0years of age. Thereafter, 1\u20102 episodes per year, occurring mainly during the\n            winter\n326\nretained foreign body, nasal septum deviation, unilateral choanal atresia, cerebrospinal\n            fluid leak and nasal polyposis can all present with rhinitis. Chronic infective rhinitis\n            (rhinosinusitis) (>3\u00a0months), particularly if severe, can be a manifestation of underlining\n            pathologies such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis or antibody deficiency.\n            Allergic rhinitis affects 3% of 4\u00a0year olds, increasing to 27% of 18\u00a0year olds( Figure\n6\n).\n327\nAllergic rhinitis in early childhood is a risk factor for developing asthma in later\n            childhood and adulthood.\n328\n,\n329\nIt has a significant impact on children's quality of life and can have detrimental\n            effects on sleep, behaviour, school performance and family dynamics.\n171\nIt often presents alongside other atopic disorders, asthma and eczema and food allergy.\n            Its presentation may be influenced by co\u2010morbidities, such as conjunctivitis, impaired\n            hearing, rhinosinusitis, sleep problems and pollen\u2010food syndrome\n330\n(Figure\n7\n).\nEntopy (local allergic rhinitis), diagnosed by nasal allergen challenge, is found\n            in children (level D).\n331\n,\n332\nThe approach to diagnosis in children is similar to that in adults: history, skin\n                  prick test and anterior rhinoscopy\nEntopy (local allergic rhinitis), diagnosed by nasal allergen challenge is found in\n                  this age group (level D)\n331\n,\n333\nTherapy of rhinitis in children is based on the same principles as in adults; however,\n                  it should take into account specific paediatric needs, such as acceptability, practicality\n                  for both children and parents and concern for potential side\u2010effects (Figure\n8\n)\nNasal saline irrigation is effective in the treatment of AR in children\n149\n,\n334\nBrief concomitant use (3\u00a0days) of topical decongestants can be helpful in children\n                  with significant nasal blockage to aid introduction of topical nasal steroid therapy\nRecommendation for continuous use of intranasal steroids can often create anxiety\n                  in parents; intranasal steroids with low bio\u2010availability have a better safety profile\n                  at recommended doses and should be used in preference (Figure\n4\n)\n335\n,\n336\nIt is advisable to monitor growth in children, especially if they are receiving steroids\n                  by multiple routes\n335\n(see also Table\n3\n)\nA short course (3 to 7\u00a0days) of oral corticosteroids may be required in severe cases.\n                  Intramuscular steroids have no role in the treatment of AR\nImmunotherapy is recommended in subjects who have not adequately responded to maximal\n                  pharmacotherapy; the potential added benefit in disease prevention should be considered\n                  when treating children\n337\n,\n338\nEducation on therapy plays an important role on treatment outcome. Both children and\n                  carers should be provided with the relevant information and appropriate training\n339\nOtitis media with effusion and/or adenoidal hypertrophy may be associated with AR;\n                  the mechanistic link is unknown. Some studies suggest benefit to these common paediatric\n                  conditions from rhinitis treatment\n340\n27 QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRES FOR RHINITIS\nThe burden of rhinitis for an individual patient can be estimated using Patient\u2010Reported\n            Outcome Measures (PROMs). Generic PROMs such as the EQ\u20105D allow a comparison between\n            different diseases and are particularly useful when calculating the incremental cost\n            of new treatments. However, a disease\u2010specific validated quality of life (QoL) questionnaire\n            is more sensitive when assessing severity of disease and response to treatment. In\n            routine clinical practice, the use of such tools allows greater focus on symptoms\n            important to the patient.\nCommonly used and validated quality of life disease\u2010specific scoring systems include\n            the RQLQ for allergic rhinitis and rhino\u2010conjunctivitis, the SNOT\u201022 or RSOM\u201031in\n            chronic rhinosinusitis and a modified SNOT\u201016 in acute rhinosinusitis.\n28 FUTURE RESEARCH\n28.1 AR\nPrevention of AR development: for example environmental changes, use of synbiotics\nAdoption of single unified scheme for assessing rhinitis control\nPrevention of progression from AR to asthma: confirmation of effect of immunotherapy,\n                     investigation of AR well\u2010controlled by pharmacotherapy\nReduction of proportion of SCUAD sufferers by combination therapies\n28.2 NAR\nPrevalence\u2014accurate figures needed\n28.3 Endotypes\nTrials of therapy in well\u2010selected endotypes\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe preparation of this document has benefited from extensive discussions within the\n            Standards of Care Committee of the BSACI, and we would like to acknowledge all the\n            members of this committee for their valuable contribution. We would like to acknowledge\n            the very valuable comments received from many BSACI members during the consultation\n            process. We also thank the contribution of our lay\u2010reader, Mrs Nikki Forrest for her\n            careful review of the draft manuscript.\nThis guideline is the revised edition for the management of allergic and non\u2010allergic\n            rhinitis. Adherence to this guideline does not constitute an automatic defence for\n            negligence, and conversely non\u2010adherence is not indicative of negligence. It is anticipated\n            that this guideline will be reviewed 5 yearly.\nNote\n*Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is a rare allergic disorder of children, especially atopic\n               boys. Its complex immunopathology involves raised IgE levels, mast cells, eosinophils\n               and other inflammatory cells in the conjunctival epithelium. Seasonal exacerbations\n               are common (hence the name), but if severe the disease can be active year round. The\n               condition is sight\u2010threatening because the corneal epithelium is under attack from\n               the products of immune reactions in the conjunctiva. Topical steroid therapy is usually\n               needed, and this too has sight\u2010threatening aspects.\nLevels of evidence\n12\nLevel of evidence\nDefinition\n1++\nHigh quality meta\u2010analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs or RCTs with a very low risk\n                                 of bias\n1+\nWell\u2010conducted meta\u2010analyses, systematic reviews, or RCTs with a low risk of bias\n1\u2212\nMeta\u2010analyses, systematic reviews, or RCTs with a high risk of bias\n2++\nHigh quality systematic reviews of case\u2010control or cohort or studiesHigh quality case\u2010control\n                                 or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability\n                                 that the relationship is causal\n2+\nWell\u2010conducted case\u2010control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias\n                                 and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal\n2\u2212\nCase\u2010control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant\n                                 risk that the relationship is not causal\n3\nNon\u2010analytic studies, for example case reports, case series\n4\nExpert opinion\nEvidence table\u2014recent combination therapy for rhinitis\nBibliographic citation\nStudy type\nEvidence level\nNo. patients\nPatient characteristics\nIntervention\nComparison\nLength of follow\u2010up\nOutcome measures\nEffect size\nSource of funding\nHas the study provided answers to the original question?\nWeakness/limitations\nCited Y/N\nCarr W 2012 JACI\n341\nMeta\u2010Analysis\n1+ (Grade A)\n3398\n12 or above.

Management is hindered because\n         most exploited fish are long\u2010lived species that utilize a variety of habitats and\n         exhibit high interannual fluctuations in abundance. Effective management requires\n         that we understand how natural and anthropogenic sources of variability in abiotic\n         variables (termed environmental quality [EQ]) affect fish population dynamics. Quantifying\n         the effects of anthropogenic changes in EQ on fish populations has remained elusive\n         and controversial. I illustrate, with examples, six issues related to quantifying\n         EQ effects on fish populations. These examples also serve as demonstrations of how\n         modeling can be used to address these issues. The six issues are: (1) detectability\u2014high\n         interannual variation and interaction effects among climatic variables that affect\n         population dynamics make isolating effects of individual stressors difficult; (2)\n         complex habitat and nonintuitive responses\u2014spatial heterogeneity in habitat can result\n         in population responses that are disproportionate to the changes in EQ; (3) regional\n         predictions\u2014biological realism is often sacrificed unnecessarily when broad spatial\n         scale predictions are needed; (4) community interactions\u2014too little attention is paid\n         to how community\u2010level interactions can affect population\u2010based analyses; (5) sublethal\n         effects\u2014sublethal effects are often ignored but can have large effects on population\n         dynamics; and (6) cumulative effects\u2014the combined effect of multiple stressors can\n         be much different than expected from the sum of their individual effects. Examples\n         include a variety of freshwater and marine species. Quantifying EQ effects on fish\n         populations can be improved by considering these issues in analyses, and by taking\n         a true multidisciplinary approach that combines individual\u2010based modeling and life\n         history theory.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

The aim of this study was to understand why some MND patients decline or withdraw from NIV.\nMethod\nNine patients with MND (male\u00a0=\u00a07, mean age\u00a0=\u00a067\u00a0years) participated in this study. These patients, from\n            a cohort of 35 patients who were offered NIV treatment to support respiratory muscle weakness, did not participate in NIV treatment when it was clinically appropriate. Semi\u2010structured interviews and interpretative\n            phenomenological analysis (IPA) were employed to explore these patient's experience of MND and their thoughts and understanding of NIV treatment.\nResults\nUsing IPA, four themes were identified: preservation of the self, negative perceptions of NIV, negative experience with health care services, and not needing NIV. Further analysis identified the fundamental issue to be the maintenance of perceived\n            self, which was interpreted to consist of the sense of autonomy, dignity, and quality\n            of life.\nConclusions\nThe findings indicate psychological reasons for disengagement with NIV.

It quantifies, present\u2010day premature mortalities\n            associated with the exposure to near\u2010surface PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nconcentrations in India using a regional chemistry model. We estimate that PM\n2.5\nexposure leads to about 570,000 (CI95: 320,000\u2013730,000) premature mortalities in\n            2011. On a national scale, our estimate of mortality by chronic obstructive pulmonary\n            disease (COPD) due to O\n3\nexposure is about 12,000 people. The Indo\u2010Gangetic region accounts for a large part\n            (~42%) of the estimated mortalities. The associated lost life expectancy is calculated\n            as 3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u2009years for all of India with highest values found for Delhi (6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u2009years).\n            The economic cost of estimated premature mortalities associated with PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nexposure is about 640 (350\u2013800) billion USD in 2011, which is a factor of 10 higher\n            than total expenditure on health by public and private expenditure.\n1 Introduction\nSurface ozone (O\n3\n) and fine particulate matter (PM\n2.5\n) are major atmospheric pollutants directly affecting human health by causing cardiovascular\n            and respiratory diseases. The environmental risk caused by exposure to these pollutants\n            has increased in many parts of the world as a result of human activity [\nBurnett et al\n.,\n2014\n;\nLelieveld et al\n.,\n2015\n;\nApte et al\n.,\n2015\n]. Poor air quality is an important societal issue specifically for developing countries\n            like India [\nGhude et al\n.,\n2014\n] where rapid expansion of industrial, urban, and traffic emissions have significantly\n            increased the air pollution especially over the last two decades [\nGhude et al\n.,\n2013\n]. Climate change can further influence air quality, as studies have shown, causing\n            O\n3\nand PM\n2.5\nto increase in many developing regions of the world [\nHorowitz\n,\n2006\n;\nFang et al\n.,\n2013\n].\nMeasurement data from National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring networks [\nCentral Pollution Control Board\n(\nCPCB\n),\n2014\n], satellite observations, estimates from emission inventories, and regional model\n            calculations [\nGhude et al\n.,\n2013\n;\nJena et al\n.,\n2015a\n] unambiguously show elevated levels of air pollutants in many regions of India. Therefore,\n            the potential risk to health is higher for populations in these regions. As indicated\n            by the 2011 census of India's statistics, around 32% (~0.4 billion people) of India's\n            1.2 billion population lives in urban areas. About 78% of the total 141 cities in\n            the country exceed the PM\n2.5\nstandard, 90 cities have critical levels, and 26 have the most critical levels, exceeding\n            the PM standard by over 3 times [\nCPCB\n,\n2014\n]. The Global Burden of Disease estimates ranks pollution as the fifth largest killer\n            in India [\nWorld Health Organization\n(\nWHO\n),\n2014\n]. Estimates of the respiratory mortality show India to rank second among the countries\n            globally affected by PM\n2.5\n[\nSilva et al\n.,\n2013\n] and O\n3\npollution [\nLelieveld et al\n.,\n2013\n]. It is anticipated that recent upward trends in transportation, industrial and energy\n            sectors, urbanizations, population growth in India along with climate change will\n            raise the levels of O\n3\nand PM\n2.5\nin the future, which could worsen the vulnerability of a growing population.\nOver the past decades, numerous studies have estimated premature mortality associated\n            with O\n3\nand PM\n2.5\npollution on global to regional scales using high\u2010resolution global chemistry transport\n            models [\nSilva et al\n.,\n2013\n;\nLelieveld et al\n.,\n2013\n;\nFang et al\n.,\n2013\n] or surface\u2010based measurements [\nCohen et al\n.,\n2004\n] and using satellite measurements [\nVan Donkelaar et al\n.,\n2010\n;\nGlobal Burden of Diseases\n(\nGBD\n),\n2010\n;\nBrauer et al\n.,\n2012\n;\nApte et al\n.,\n2015\n]. Most of these studies were focused on the United States and Europe and relatively\n            little work has been devoted to India. Studies that relate air quality and human health\n            have been performed only focusing on a few urban areas of India [\nGupta\n,\n2011\n;\nGuttikunda and Goel\n,\n2013\n;\nChate et al\n.,\n2013\n;\nNagpure et al\n.,\n2014\n] using aggregated data of local air quality. This study assesses the impact of only\n            outdoor air quality on health for all of India on district scale. To our knowledge,\n            the present study is the first high\u2010resolution district\u2010scale modeling study for India\n            to investigate and quantify premature mortality due to O\n3\nand PM\n2.5\nexposure. Here we estimate the burden of present\u2010day anthropogenic air pollution\n            on premature human mortality using a high\u2010resolution regional chemistry transport\n            model with anthropogenic emissions from Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP)\u2010v2,\n            combined with the latest district\u2010wise population count data sets [\nIndia Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner\n,\n2011\n] for India. It should be noted that the model is unable to simulate microenvironments\n            (such as near roadways) and our analysis does not consider indoor exposure from cooking\n            and heating.\nOur estimates of PM\n2.5\n\u2010caused premature mortalities are based on\nGBD\n[\n2010\n], applying integrated exposure response functions developed by\nBurnett et al\n. [\n2014\n], which accounts for health effect at even higher exposure concentrations. We have\n            estimated premature mortalities due to ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular\n            disease (CEV, stroke), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer\n            (LC) for adult population, and acute lower respiratory illness (ALRI) for infants\n            (<5\u2009years old) linked to PM\n2.5\nexposure. For estimating COPD linked to O\n3\nexposure we used the exposure response function by\nOstro\n[\n2004\n]. Additionally, this study calculates the economic loss and lost life expectancy\n            due to PM\n2.5\nexposure. Surface O\n3\nand PM\n2.5\nconcentrations over India vary significantly among the Indian states, largely due\n            to differences in emission patterns and regional meteorology (Figure\nS1\nin the supporting information). Therefore, we also address the state\u2010wise impacts\n            of air quality degradation on premature mortality, economic cost, and lost life expectancy.\n2 Method\n2.1 Regional Chemistry Modeling\nWe used version 3.6.1 of the regional Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled\n               with chemistry (WRF\u2010Chem) to simulate hourly surface O\n3\nand PM\n2.5\ndistributions for the entire year of 2011 at 36\u2009km horizontal resolution in order\n               to resolve urban and rural regions. The model was driven by National Centers for Environmental\n               Prediction Final (GFS/FNL) meteorological reanalysis fields. The model uses MOZART\u20104\n               gas\u2010phase chemistry linked to the GOCART aerosol scheme. The GOCART aerosol model\n               simulates five major types of aerosols, namely, sulfate, black carbon, organic carbon,\n               dust, and sea salt. Anthropogenic emissions of CO, NO\nX\n, SO\n2\n, NMVOC, PM10, PM\n2.5\n, and BC/OC are taken from the HTAP\u2010v2 inventory [\nhttp://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/htap_v2/\n]. Fire emissions were provided to the model using the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINNv1).\n               More details on the modeling setup are discussed by\nJena et al\n. [\n2015b\n].\nKumar et al\n. [\n2012\n] discuss in detail the validation of meteorological fields over India and shows that\n               the index of agreement for important meteorological parameters is greater than 0.6,\n               indicating that WRF\u2010Chem is capable of simulating the variations around the observed\n               mean. Detailed descriptions of the chemistry simulations, including a discussion of\n               the anthropogenic, biogenic and fire emissions, chemical boundary conditions, and\n               meteorological inputs are given by\nGhude et al\n. [\n2013\n] and\nJena et al\n. [\n2015a\n]. We evaluate the model performance by comparing modeled aerosol optical depth (AOD\n550\n) with MODIS AOD\n550\n(Figure\nS2\n), and simulated monthly mean PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nwith observations from different ground sites in India (Figures\nS3\nand\nS4\n). The model reproduces the observed distribution of AOD\n550\nvery well (mean bias\u2009=\u2009\u22120.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1) but shows lower values over the Indo\u2010Gangetic\n               Plain (IGP) region. The model also reproduces the seasonality of surface PM\n2.5\nof the sites in India. Both observations and model results show the largest PM\n2.5\nconcentrations for Delhi and Agra, but the model tends to overestimate summertime\n               and underestimate wintertime values (Figure\nS3\n). For ozone, the model shows a similar seasonality as the observations, but for most\n               sites the model is biased high throughout the year. While the PM\n2.5\nmodel bias is relatively low, the model bias is large for surface O\n3\n(about 10\u201330\u2009ppb) at some of the sites in India. Most of these observational sites\n               are situated in urban/suburban locations which generally represent very local conditions\n               and may not be indicative of the overall model performance. High NO\nX\nemissions [\nJena et al\n.,\n2015b\n], coarser model grid spacing [\nKumar et al\n.,\n2012\n], and underestimation of dry deposition [\nMartin et al\n.,\n2014\n] could also be contributing factors that may lead to an overestimation of ozone production\n               and should be investigated in further detail. As will be discussed later, we try to\n               account for the high model bias in O\n3\nwhen estimating premature mortality.\n2.2 Health Impact\nThe latest district\u2010wise population count and age structure data set used in this\n               work is taken from the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, Government of India\n               for the year 2011 (Figure\n1\na). These district\u2010wise population data are mapped to the 36\u2009km model grid using GIS\u2010based\n               statistical methodology. According to the Census 2011, around 31% (37 million) of\n               the residents are 0\u201314 years old and 5% (~6.6 million) of the residents are above\n               65\u2009years old. Approximately, 32% of this population (in all age groups) resides in\n               urban areas.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nDistribution of (a) district\u2010wise India's population and total premature mortalities\n                        due to (b) PM\n2.5\nand (c) O\n3\nexposure in 2011.

[\n2014\n],\nLelieveld et al\n. [\n2015\n], and\nApte et al\n. [\n2015\n] for present\u2010day concentrations. To estimate the premature mortalities we combined\n               the results with epidemiological exposure response functions by using the following\n               relationship:\n(1)\nIn equation\n1\n, \u0394\nM\nis a function of the baseline mortality rate of a particular disease category\n\u03b4c\nfor countries estimated by the\nWorld Health Organization\n(\nWHO\n) [\n2012\n].\nP\nis the population count for the specific age category. In this work the baseline\n               mortality rate for a specific disease is obtained from the WHO health statistics and\n               health information system. RR is relative risk and (RR\u2009\u2212\u20091)/RR is the attributable\n               fraction.\nBurnett et al\n. [\n2014\n] developed integrated exposure response functions that constrain the shape of the\n               C\u2010R relationship using mortality data for even higher PM\n2.5\nexposure concentration, which may represent the countries where PM\n2.5\nlevels can be much higher such as East and South Asia. The value of RR attributable\n               to PM\n2.5\nexposure is calculated for different disease categories for adults (IHD, CEV (stroke),\n               COPD, and LC, and acute lower respiratory illness (ALRI) for infant population). Here\n               we have used RR derived by\nBurnett et al\n. [\n2014\n] that parameterizes the dependence of RR on concentration (\nX\n) based on the metaanalysis of observed data:\n(2)\nFor each disease categories,\nX\n0\nrepresents the theoretical minimum\u2010risk concentrations (range: 5.8\u20138.0\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\n\u22123\n). We also adopted the bounds representing the 95% confidence interval (CI) which\n               was derived by\nBurnett et al\n. [\n2014\n] from 1000 sets of coefficients and exposure response functions based on Monte Carlo\n               simulations. For estimating COPD linked to O\n3\nexposure we applied the exposure response function by\nOstro\n[\n2004\n]:\n(3)\nwhere\nX\n0\n=\u200937.6 [\nLim et al\n.,\n2012\n] and is the average of the range of 33.3\u201341.9\u2009ppbv O\n3\n, and\n\u03b4\nis 0.1521 [\nLim et al\n.,\n2012\n]. More discussion on uncertainties and sensitivity calculations that address the\n               shape of exposure response function is given in detail in\nBurnett et al\n. [\n2014\n] and\nLim et al\n. [\n2012\n].\nUsing the model\u2010simulated annual mean PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nfields, the premature mortalities for five different diseases are estimated for population\n               in each model grid. The state and national level mortalities are estimated for the\n               year 2011 by summing all grid within the state and national boundaries (Figure\n1\na). We find higher O\n3\nand PM\n2.5\nconcentrations over most of the densely populated regions but with a strong seasonal\n               variability (Figure\nS1\n).\nWe also evaluate state and nationwide economic cost of the health impact associated\n               with the PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nexposure during 2011. We used the value of the statistical life (VSL) to evaluate\n               the cost of premature mortalities. VSL is widely used in the USA and Europe in cost\u2010benefit\n               analysis to assess the benefits of saving lives [\nOECD\n,\n2014\n]. In India, estimates of VSL on original country\u2010specific studies are scarce. Therefore,\n               the benefits transfer approach has been applied, with estimates of VSL from developed\n               countries being transferred after adjusting for differences in income or national\n               per capita output as suggested in\nOECD\n[\n2014\n] and\nChen et al\n. [\n2015\n]. To establish the India\u2010specific VSL we used the following equation:\n(4)\nVSL\nIc\nis estimated VSL for India for current year, VSL\nD\nb\nis adopted VSL for developed countries (e.g., USA or Europe) for the base year,\nG\nIC\nand\nG\nDC\nare the Gross Domestic Product per capita at the Purchasing Power (PPP) in India\n               and developed countries for the current year, %\u0394\nP\nand %\u0394\nY\nare the percentage increase in consumer price and real GDP per capita growth in India\n               from base year to current year, respectively.\n\u03b2\nis income elasticity of VSL. Using this approach, we estimate a VSL of USD 1.1 million\n               for India in 2011 (see\nSupporting Information S1\n).\nFor calculating lost life expectancy due to PM\n2.5\nexposure we followed the estimate in\nPope et al\n. [\n2009\n]. As per their estimate, an increase of 1\u2009\u00b5g/m\n3\nin PM\n2.5\nexposure decreases mean life expectancy by about 0.061\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\u2009years. This estimate\n               is derived for higher\u2010income countries, where average PM\n2.5\nconcentrations are lower than those found for India and may introduce some additional\n               uncertainties in our estimates.\n3 Results\n3.1 Health Impact Assessment\nFigure\n1\na shows the population distribution for India in 2011, while Figures\n1\nb and\n1\nc show estimates of PM\n2.5\n\u2010related premature mortalities (per grid box) linked to CEV, COPD, IHD, LC, and ALRI,\n               and O\n3\n\u2010related mortalities by COPD in 2011, respectively. The estimated premature mortalities\n               are a function of both the population and air quality in each grid cell resulting\n               in high premature mortalities in heavily polluted and populated areas. As seen in\n               Figure\n1\n, premature mortality is widespread in India. The Indo\u2010Gangetic Plain (IGP) shows\n               highest estimated premature mortalities due to both ground level PM\n2.5\n(300\u2013800 excess cases/grid box) and O\n3\n(25\u201360 excess cases/grid box), followed by Southern India (Tamil Nadu and Kerala),\n               and Mumbai\u2010Gujarat Industrial corridor. Among the different polluted areas, the largest\n               share of premature mortalities is in the IGP region with about 42% for PM\n2.5\nexposure and 45% for O\n3\nexposure. This is a point of concern because one eighth of the world population resides\n               in this region and most models and future projections based on Representative Concentration\n               Pathways (RCPs) emission scenarios predict significant increase in O\n3\nand PM\n2.5\nconcentrations from this region due to climate change [\nHorowitz\n,\n2006\n;\nFang et al\n.,\n2013\n]. The number of cases of premature mortalities due to PM\n2.5\nexposure from IGP region is estimated to be ~240,000. (95%CI: 140,000\u2013300,000). This\n               is equivalent to the estimate of 240,000 (in 2005) deaths globally attributed to PM\n2.5\ncontribution from surface transportation [\nChambliss et al\n.,\n2014\n]. Substantial premature mortalities due to PM\n2.5\n(300\u2013600 excess cases/grid boxes) and O\n3\n(10\u201340 excess cases/grid box) exposure are also seen in the northeastern India, although\n               this region is moderately populated. This region shows less influence from anthropogenic\n               activities [\nGhude et al\n.,\n2013\n] but elevated levels of PM\n2.5\nand surface O\n3\nduring premonsoon time as a result of biomass burning [\nJena et al\n.,\n2015a\n] (Figure\nS1\n). Figures\n1\nb and\n1\nc also distinguish metropolitan areas and big cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata,\n               and Bangalore as locations where air pollution causes a significant number of premature\n               mortalities.\nTo illustrate the state\u2010wise pattern of premature mortalities, we present a bar chart\n               (Figures\n2\na and\n2\nb) showing the excess number of cases due to PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nexposure for various health outcomes (Adults: IHD, CEV (stroke), COPD, and LC; infants:\n               ALRI). The state with the highest premature mortalities due to PM\n2.5\nexposure is Uttar Pradesh (UP), which accounts for about 15% (about 86,000 excess\n               cases) of all premature mortalities in India during 2011, followed by Maharashtra\n               (MH, 10%), and West Bengal (WB, 9%) and Bihar (BR, 8%). Other states with high premature\n               mortalities due to PM\n2.5\nare Andhra Pradesh (AP), Tamil Nadu (TN), Gujarat (GJ), Karnataka (KA), Madhya Pradesh\n               (MP), Orrisa (OR), and Rajasthan (RJ), which collectively make up for 32% of the countrywide\n               premature mortalities. For O\n3\n\u2010related mortalities by COPD, the greatest premature mortalities are found in UP,\n               with about 5500 excess cases (about 18%), followed by BR (11%), WB (9.5%), and MH\n               and AP (7%). It can be seen that, premature mortalities due to O\n3\nexposure for other states show a similar pattern to that of PM\n2.5\npremature mortalities.\nFigure 2\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nEstimates of the state\u2010wise premature mortalities due to (a) PM\n2.5\nand (b) O\n3\nexposure for various health outcomes (TOMR, CARD, RESP, and COPD) in 2011.

(c) State\u2010wise premature\n                           mortalities estimated from the satellite\u2010derived and simulated PM2.5 concentrations.\nThe premature mortalities for different health outcomes are summarized in Table\n1\n. Our estimate of nationwide premature mortalities related to PM\n2.5\nexposure in 2011 is about 570,000 people (47 people per 10\n5\npopulation) with the 95% confidence interval, 320,000\u2013730,000. For adults (age >25\u2009years)\n               premature mortalities linked to IHD, CEV (stroke), COPD, and LC are estimated to be\n               about 250,000 (95%CI: 190,000\u2013310,000), 190,000 (95%CI: 70,000\u2013240,000), 120,000 (95%CI:\n               61,000\u2013160,000), and 2700 (95%CI: 1000\u20133600) people, respectively. Premature mortalities\n               (ALRI) for children <5\u2009years old are estimated at about 7300 (95%CI: 4900\u20139000). Our\n               nationally aggregated estimate of O\n3\n\u2010related premature total mortality by COPD is about 31,000 (95%CI: 23,000\u201339,000)\n               people, which agrees very much with the estimate by\nLelieveld et al\n. [\n2015\n].\nTable 1.\nPremature Mortalities Due To PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nExposure in India During 2011\nHealth Endpoints\nPremature Mortalities (95% CI) (Simulated PM\n2.5\n)\nPremature Mortalities\n(Satellite PM\n2.5\n)\n1\nIschemic heart disease (IHD)\na\n250,000 (190,000\u2013310,000)\n260,000\n2\nCerebrovascular disease (CEV, stroke)\na\n190,000 (70,000\u2013240, 000)\n200,000\n3\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\na\n117,000 (61,000\u2013165,000)\n135,000\n4\nLung cancer (LC)\na\n2,700 (1,000\u20133,600)\n3,100\n5\nAcute lower respiratory illness (ALRI)\nb\n7,300 (4,900\u20139,000)\n8,200\n6\nCOPD due to O\n3\na\n31,000 (23,000\u201339,000)\na\nFor adult population (>25\u2009years old).\nb\nFor infants (<5\u2009years old).\nIn addition to simulated PM\n2.5\nconcentration, we determined the annual estimate of ground level PM\n2.5\nusing column aerosol optical depth (AOD) [\nVan Donkelaar et al.\n,\n2010\n] from the MODIS satellite instruments and coincident simulated vertical aerosol profiles\n               from simulations described in section\n2.1\n(see\nSupporting Information S1\n). We further estimated premature mortalities from the satellite\u2010derived surface PM\n2.5\nfor 2011 similar to estimates made in recent studies [\nGBD\n,\n2010\n;\nBrauer et al\n.,\n2012\n;\nApte et al\n.,\n2015\n]. Figure\n2\nc shows the comparison between premature mortalities estimated from the satellite\n               and simulated PM\n2.5\nconcentrations for different states of India, and Table\n1\nshows the comparison for the different health outcome. It can be seen that satellite\u2010based\n               total mortalities are a little bit higher than the simulated PM\n2.5\nexposure. Our nationwide estimated premature mortalities from satellite\u2010derived PM\n2.5\nexposure is about 601,000 people, which is about 6% higher than the estimate derived\n               from the simulated PM\n2.5\nexposure. The total number of mortalities estimated (both from simulated and satellite\u2010derived\n               PM\n2.5\nconcentration) in this study compares closely to the\nWHO\n[\n2014\n] estimate of 0.62 million,\nApte et al\n. [\n2015\n] estimate of 0.57 million, and\nLelieveld et al\n. [\n2015\n] estimate of 0.62 million (South Asia) deaths due to air pollution in India. It is\n               double in magnitude to that of 300,000 deaths globally caused by human impact of global\n               warming and climate change [\nGBD\n,\n2010\n]. It should be noted that premature mortalities estimated in this study is in addition\n               to near\u2010source exposure such as indoor cooking and heating [\nLim et al\n.,\n2013\n].\nSimulated O\n3\nconcentrations are positively biased by about 10\u201330\u2009ppb over the India region. Therefore,\n               the estimated premature mortalities (31,000) due to O\n3\nexposure might be on the higher side. In order to see the impact of bias on estimated\n               premature mortalities due to O\n3\nexposure we performed additional calculations by reducing O\n3\namount by 15\u2009ppb over the entire simulation domain. Assuming that the bias in O\n3\n(15\u2009ppb) is entirely due to the model performance (and all other factors are correct)\n               and representative for all of India, the bias\u2010corrected mortalities are estimated\n               to be about 12,000 people.\nEstimated mortalities are subject to several sources of uncertainty including uncertainties\n               in the model parameterizations (e.g., emissions and physical/chemical parameterizations)\n               and uncertainties in the exposure response functions (e.g., RR values). Taking into\n               account the variability in various emissions for South Asia, the uncertainty in PM\n2.5\nemissions could be as much as 30% [\nKurokawa et al\n.,\n2013\n]. This adds an uncertainty of about 12% in the estimated premature mortalities due\n               to PM\n2.5\nexposure. Additional sources of uncertainties in our estimate lie in the use of a\n               specific chemical mechanism to simulate PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nconcentration. The GOCART aerosol scheme used in the present simulation does not\n               include nitrate and Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA) production; therefore, nitrate\n               and SOA are missing in the simulated PM\n2.5\nconcentration. The relative contribution of nitrate and SOA in PM\n2.5\nis estimated to be 10% and 15% in India [\nBehera and Sharma\n,\n2010\n], which adds uncertainty of about 3% and 5%, respectively, in the estimated premature\n               mortalities due to PM\n2.5\nexposure. Variability in different NO\nX\nemission inventories in India leads to an uncertainty of about 15% in daytime\u2010simulated\n               O\n3\nconcentration [\nJena et al\n.,\n2015b\n], which adds uncertainty of about 36% in the estimated premature mortalities due\n               to O\n3\nexposure. Overall uncertainty due to combination of above input parameters translate\n               into about 21% in our premature mortality estimates. RR values used in this study\n               are derived from the integrated exposure response functions that constrain the shape\n               of the C\u2010R relationship using mortality data for higher PM\n2.5\nexposure concentration; however, it is based on epidemiological cohort studies conducted\n               in other parts of the globe, which may not necessarily represent conditions in South\n               Asia. This requires future region\u2010specific epidemiological research for constraining\n               the shape of the PM\n2.5\nconcentration\u2010response relation. Due to the lack of India\u2010specific epidemiological\n               exposure response functions it is hard to quantify related uncertainties in our premature\n               mortality estimates.\nWe calculated the nationwide and statewide economic cost due to premature mortalities\n               linked to PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nexposure using equation\n4\n. We computed VSL for India to be about 1.1 million USD in 2011 adjusted by GDP per\n               capita on PPP basis. The state\u2010wise economic cost due to premature mortality of PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nexposure is largest in Uttar Pradesh (98 billion USD) followed by Maharashtra (62\n               billion USD), West Bengal (57 billion USD), and Bihar (53 billion USD) (Figure\n3\na). On a national scale, we estimate the economic cost to be about 640 (350\u2013800) billion\n               USD\n2011\nannually because of total premature mortalities due to PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nexposure under modeled present\u2010day pollution levels. The total GDP of India was 1840\n               billion USD and total expenditure on health (public plus private) as percentage of\n               GDP in 2011 for India was 3.9% [\nOECD\n,\n2013\n], i. e., approximately 60 billion USD. The economic cost due to PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nexposure estimated in this study is much larger than the total health expenditure\n               by government in 2011.\nFigure 3\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nEstimates of the state\u2010wise (a) economic loss due to total mortalities by PM\n2.5\nand O\n3,\nand (b) mean lost life expectancy due to PM\n2.5\nexposure in India during 2011.\nCaption\nEstimates of the state\u2010wise (a) economic loss due to total mortalities by PM2.5 and\n                           O3, and (b) mean lost life expectancy due to PM2.5 exposure in India during 2011.\nWe further estimated health burden in terms of life years lost due to PM\n2.5\nexposure following the estimates given in\nPope et al\n. [\n2009\n]. Nationally, PM\n2.5\nexposure is estimated to cause a life year lost of about 3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1\u2009years, on average.\n               However, the regional variability is significant. Figure\n3\nb shows the estimated life years lost due to annual averaged PM\n2.5\nexposure by state. The lowest lost life expectancy is noticed in Jammu Kashmir (~0.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009years)\n               followed by Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim (~1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009years). Delhi suffered the greatest\n               lost life expectancy of about 6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u2009years, followed by west Bengal (6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u2009years)\n               and Bihar (5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u2009years), which are also the top three polluted states in India\n               (Figure\n3\na). This is a point of concern because overall average life expectancy is already\n               low (64\u2009years) in India; ranked 150 worldwide in 2012 and future increase in PM\n2.5\nconcentration may worsen the situation.\n4 Conclusion\nOur study suggests that the widespread PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\npollution under present emission levels considerably impact human mortalities and\n            life expectancy in India. The present\u2010day premature mortalities due to PM\n2.5\n(~570,000) and O\n3\n(31,000) exposure caused economic cost of approximately 640 billion USD, which is\n            a factor of 10 higher than total expenditure on health by public and private expenditure\n            in India. Simulated O\n3\nconcentrations are positively biased (about 10\u201330\u2009ppb) over the India region, which\n            might put our estimated premature mortalities (31,000) due to O\n3\nexposure on the high side. Our bias\u2010corrected total mortalities estimate is less\n            than half of this, about 12,000 people. In April 2015, the Union Environmental Ministry\n            of Government of India launched a national Air Quality Index as a major aggressive\n            initiative for improving air quality in urban areas for air pollution mitigation and\n            to meet clean\u2010air standards for reducing the public health risk. Our estimates on\n            premature mortalities, economic loss, and life lost years provide important information\n            to elective members and policy makers to propose or impose emission controls to benefit\n            reduced public health risk due to exposure to outdoor air pollution. Therefore, these\n            results may have important policy implications considering the projected future increase\n            in PM\n2.5\nand O\n3\nand implementation of revised air quality standard for India.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the Director, IITM, for his encouragement.

The widely used indicator for water resources, the total input of water used,\n         is not adequate to assess water resources from a sustainability perspective. More\n         detailed indicators are proposed for water resources in two areas essential to water\n         sustainability: water quantity and water quality. The governing principles for a consideration\n         of water quantity are that (1) the water sources or LCA inputs are renewable and sustainable\n         and (2) the volume of water released or LCA outputs are returned to humans or ecosystems\n         for further use downstream. The governing principle for a consideration of water quality\n         is that the utility of the returned water is not impaired for either humans or ecosystems\n         downstream. Water quantity indicators are defined for water use, consumption, and\n         depletion to reveal the sustainable or nonsustainable nature of the sources.

Seminal experimental investigations on the damaging effects\n            of oxidative stress and the mitigating effects of antioxidant defences were conducted\n            primarily in domesticated organisms.\n2.\nIn recent years, ecologists have taken to studying antioxidants and oxidative stress\n            in free\u2010ranging organisms and have integrated principles of oxidative stress into\n            several core evolutionary concepts, such as life\u2010history trade\u2010offs (e.g. survival\n            vs. reproduction), senescence and sexual selection. This initial flurry of studies\n            has provided major advances in our understanding of how antioxidant defences evolve\n            and function.\n3.\nIn this overview, it is our goal to provide ecologists with an accessible summary\n            of (i) the biochemical basis and conceptual frameworks behind oxidative stress and\n            antioxidants, (ii) the research questions and hypotheses that are generated by incorporating\n            antioxidants and oxidative stress into models of life\u2010history theory, ageing, mate\n            selection, and honest signalling, and (iii) the trends in the evidence that have emerged\n            from initial studies in these areas.\n4.\nThough much progress has been made on the ecological and evolutionary relevance of\n            antioxidant and oxidative stress physiology, no consensus has emerged regarding the\n            primacy of how oxidative stress challenges or antioxidant limits or values shape organismal\n            life\u2010histories. However, there are many taxonomic biases in studies to date and several\n            ideal environmental systems that are as\u2010of\u2010yet untapped.\nIntroduction\nThe integration of ecology and physiology is central for understanding proximate mechanisms\n            underlying the evolution of life\u2010history strategies and the way that animals respond\n            to environmental perturbations. In the last several years, a new area of ecological\n            research has emerged, in which levels of antioxidants (AO) and oxidative stress (OS)\n            are quantified in organisms and used as proximate endpoints to explain a number of\n            ecological patterns. In this article, we review this relatively young field, placing\n            particular emphasis on the fact that there are extensive bodies of literature in other\n            fields (e.g. medicine, nutrition) that catalysed this new subdiscipline and that must\n            be more completely understood to advance AO\u2010ecology research techniques and questions.\n            Though some recent reviews exist in this area (\nvon Schantz\net\u00a0al.\n1999\n;\nCostantini 2008\n;\nMonaghan, Metcalfe & Torres 2009\n), we focus on topics such as the evolution of sexual ornaments and the costs of reproduction\n            that have received comparatively less attention to date. Also, we try to regularly\n            integrate biochemistry with ecology to describe the biochemical patterns underlying\n            ecological phenomena and why such knowledge is important to ecological investigations.\n            Finally, we provide historical information on reactive chemical species, OS physiology,\n            and AO to provide an accessible compilation of this material for functional ecologists.\nHistorical overview of reactive species biochemistry\nAround 2\u00b745 billion years ago, during the Great Oxidation Event, atmospheric oxygen\n            increased dramatically as a result of the adaptive radiation of photosynthetic organisms\n            (\nSessions\net\u00a0al.\n2009\n). An important consequence of this change in atmospheric chemistry was that living\n            organisms evolved physiological mechanisms to use oxygen to produce energy. Additionally,\n            organisms found it necessary to protect themselves against the toxicity of oxygen\n            and to mitigate the negative effects of oxidation. Thus, oxygen free radicals were\n            likely an important selective pressure during the incipient stages of oxidative metabolism,\n            and indeed throughout much of the history of life.\nThe damaging effects of oxygen involve a loss of cell functionality resulting from\n            reactive species\u2010induced oxidation of macromolecules (i.e. oxidative damage; OD).\n            Oxygen free radicals, which are predominately, but not exclusively, derived from oxidative\n            metabolism, are responsible for this oxidation. The modern organic chemistry of free\n            radicals dates back to 1900, when Moses Gomberg identified the triphenylmethyl radical.\n            After much subsequent debate, a free radical was defined as any transient (chemically\n            unstable) species (atom, molecule, or ion;\nBernthsen 1942\n;\nHerzberg 1971\n). Most recently, a free radical has been defined as any chemical species capable\n            of independent existence that contains one or more unpaired electrons (\nHalliwell & Gutteridge 2007\n). Radicals can be formed through several chemical reactions (see Figs\u00a0S1). In addition,\n            there are a number of other chemicals (e.g. H\n2\nO\n2\n, HOCl, singlet oxygen, peroxynitrite) that, despite lacking radical properties, are\n            important oxidizing agents in biological systems because they quickly and readily\n            react with, and thus damage, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Reactive oxygen\n            species (ROS) is a collective term that describes all pro\u2010oxidants derived from O\n2\n. However, there are also pro\u2010oxidants derived from other elements, such as nitrogen\n            (reactive nitrogen species; RNS). In this review, we have referred to the biochemistry\n            of \u2018reactive species\u2019 (RS), which is the most inclusive name for all pro\u2010oxidants.\nIt was only between the 1950s and 1960s that biochemists demonstrated the existence\n            of free radicals in living systems and suggested free radicals were responsible for\n            cell deterioration and senescence (\nCommoner, Townsend & Pake 1954\n;\nGershman\net\u00a0al.\n1954\n;\nHarman 1956\n;\nMcCord & Fridovich 1968, 1969\n). Since that time, the number of studies on chemicals with pro\u2010oxidant activity increased\n            dramatically and today the study of oxidative physiology has a central role in modern\n            medicine and biology (e.g.\nFridovich 1978\n;\nBeckman & Ames 1998\n;\nHalliwell & Gutteridge 2007\n).\nAntioxidants: the other side of the coin\nIn the 19th century, engineers discovered that certain substances \u2013 AO \u2013 were able\n            to prevent metal from corroding by shutting off the oxidation process. Although the\n            reasons why AO were effective at preventing oxidation were poorly understood, scientists\n            began applying these principles to biotechnology and found that adding AO to foods\n            high in unsaturated fat prevented the onset of rancidity (\nHalliwell & Gutteridge 2007\n). The importance of AO in biological systems gained further support with the discovery\n            of superoxide dismutase (SOD), the enzyme responsible for scavenging the superoxide\n            radical (\nMcCord & Fridovich 1968, 1969\n). Subsequently, a variety of AO classes have been identified, including diet\u2010derived\n            and endogenous chemicals (e.g. vitamins, carotenoids) and endogenously produced enzymes\n            (e.g. SOD).\nToday, even in the biomedical and biochemical literature, the term AO is still not\n            clearly and consistently defined. Here, we define AO as molecules or structures that\n            prevent or minimize oxidative damage. We adopt a broader view here than in traditional\n            definitions to allow the inclusion of structural and repair mechanisms that remove\n            oxidative damage to a target molecule. Ecologists have measured AO capacity both at\n            the individual molecule level and as generalized AO capacity. However, because AO\n            have other biological functions, and because levels may be regulated in response to\n            need, interpretation of AO levels in relation to oxidative balance (i.e. homeostatic/homeodynamic\n            equilibrium between reactive species production and the control of their potentially\n            harmful effects) is not straightforward and should be undertaken with caution (see\n            also\nH\u00f5rak & Cohen 2010\n).\nOxidative stress\nCells are in a dynamic redox state when RS and AO are in balance. Typically, when\n            RS moderately increase, the AO system responds and resets the former oxidative balance.\n            However, an imbalance between RS production and AO response, in favour of the former,\n            increases the rate at which OD takes place and results in OS (\nSies 1991\n;\nHalliwell & Gutteridge 2007\n;\nCostantini & Verhulst 2009\n). In practice, ecologists use proxy measures of OS. How these measures relate to\n            fitness and the baseline stable redox state, however, is often unclear. Nonetheless,\n            in this review, we sometimes use the term OS in relation to a proxy measure even when\n            the utility of the measure is weak or unknown. In the future, it will be vital to\n            consider how indicators of increased free radical production, free radical levels,\n            free radical damage, AO levels, or decreased resistance to damage actually relate\n            to OS (see\nH\u00f5rak & Cohen 2010\n).\nIn 2004, Dotan\net\u00a0al.\nsuggested that there can be different types of OS, depending on what macromolecular\n            component is oxidatively damaged. Furthermore, because an oxidative insult can damage\n            certain molecules (e.g. DNA) but not others (e.g. proteins, lipids),\nDotan, Lichtenberg & Pinchuk (2004)\nsuggested that the level of peroxidation to certain molecules cannot be used as a\n            measure of universal OS. We do not yet have the data necessary to conclude whether\n            differences in peroxidation by molecular type are ecologically relevant; while it\n            may be that simply measuring lipid peroxidation provides a general picture regarding\n            resource\u2010based trade\u2010offs, it is also plausible that different fitness\u2010related phenomena\n            (e.g. physiological dysfunction, disease, senescence) may be differentially affected\n            by OD of different molecules or tissues.\nMechanisms of OD differ by cellular target, and include lipid peroxidation, protein\n            oxidation, and nucleic acid oxidation (see Figs\u00a0S2\u2013S4). For more comprehensive biochemical\n            descriptions of lipid peroxidation and damage to proteins and nucleic acids, we suggest\n            the following reviews (\nPorter, Caldwell & Mills 1995\n;\nCadet\net\u00a0al.\n2003\n;\nChakravarti & Chakravarti 2007\n;\nHalliwell & Gutteridge 2007\n;\nLaguerre, Lecomte & Villeneuve 2007\n;\nHouben\net\u00a0al.\n2008\n). However, it is important to note that, although RS have been traditionally viewed\n            as toxic products of metabolism, RS are also essential components of cell signalling\n            and regulation (i.e. redox messengers;\nThannickal & Fanburg 2000\n;\nDr\u00f6ge 2002\n), and ecologists should be careful to avoid the oversimplification of pronouncing\n            all RS as \u2018bad\u2019. This is particularly relevant in light of evidence that the exposure\n            of an organism to a low dose of a chemical agent or environmental stressor that is\n            damaging at higher doses induces an adaptive beneficial effect on the organism itself\n            (hormesis,\nMattson & Calabrese 2010\n).\nComplex interactions among RS, AO and OS\nThere exist a number of challenges to quantifying and tracking interactions between\n            AO and OS within an organism (see\nH\u00f5rak & Cohen 2010\n). For example, food intake (and associated AO supplies) can be challenging to track\n            for almost any wild animal. Moreover, the synergistic nature of AO contributes to\n            the difficulties of quantifying organismal redox balance. Additionally, levels of\n            AO and OS differ among tissues (\nPowers\net\u00a0al.\n2004\n), some of which can only be sampled post\u2010mortem. Dietary AO are particularly susceptible\n            to mobilization and redistribution among tissues. However, their contribution to protection\n            against OS is still unclear in many animal models, including humans, because some\n            of them (e.g. flavonoids) exert a myriad of biological functions (\nHalliwell & Gutteridge 2007\n). In the future, it will be important to evaluate the contribution and relative strengths\n            of each AO type to protect against OD\nin vivo\n(e.g.\nCostantini & M\u00f8ller 2009\n;\nCostantini & Verhulst 2009\n). In doing so, it will be important to consider that exogenous AO can interact with\n            endogenous AO, potentially resulting in a decrease in overall AO protection. For example,\n            high dietary doses of vitamin C are ineffective at prolonging lifespan in mice because\n            any positive benefits derived as an AO are offset by compensatory reductions in endogenous\n            protection mechanisms, leading to no net reduction in accumulated OD (\nSelman\net\u00a0al.\n2006\n). Interactions between different AO may also arise during specific life\u2010history stages\n            and may modulate allocation trade\u2010offs of AO (e.g. allocation of AO to eggs in birds;\nCostantini 2010\n). Finally, it is also important to remember that AO levels by themselves are not\n            enough to make inferences regarding OS (\nCostantini & Verhulst 2009\n), as an animal exposed to less OS may simply circulate or accumulate lower levels\n            of AO, and care should be taken when interpreting results from studies that measure\n            AO protection but not OD.\nEcological and evolutionary issues of OS\nEnvironment\nEnvironmental conditions across a range of habitat types are associated with OS threats.\n               For example, marine environments vary widely in thermal characteristics, partial pressure\n               of oxygen, degree of pollution and light environment, all of which can influence the\n               degree of oxidative insult experienced by an individual, and many marine organisms\n               adjust their AO systems in response to this environmental variability to maintain\n               a stable redox state (reviewed in\nLesser 2006\n;\nButtemer, Adele & Costantini 2010\n). Furthermore, within species, population densities can vary with habitat and, at\n               least in freshwater clams (\nSphaerium\nsp), some of this variation has been tied to OD; clams were most abundant and showed\n               lower levels of nucleic acid damage in relatively more hypoxic environments (\nJoyner\u2010Matos\net\u00a0al.\n2007\n).\nFurther environmentally driven variation in an organism\u2019s oxidative exposure and AO\n               system can be a product of season (snails,\nHelix aspersa\n;\nRamos\u2010Vasconcelos, Cardoso & Hermes\u2010Lima 2005\n), thermotolerance (grasses;\nBanowetz\net\u00a0al.\n2007\n), osmotic stress (reeds;\nZhao\net\u00a0al.\n2008\n), atrophy (burrowing frogs,\nCyclorana alboguttata\n;\nHudson\net\u00a0al.\n2006\n), nutrient starvation (\nMycobacterium avium\n;\nGumber\net\u00a0al.\n2009\n) and seed dormancy (\nOracz\net\u00a0al.\n2009\n), sometimes with RS playing an essential signalling role (\nBailly, El\u2010Maarouf\u2010Bouteau & Corbineau 2008\n). These few examples demonstrate the wide variety of ecological contexts in which\n               RS affect organismal behaviour, physiology, distribution and fitness, and highlight\n               the breadth of research areas that remain to be explored.\nOrganismal self\u2010maintenance and survival behaviours\nIn sports medicine and laboratory studies of exercise, the role of locomotor activity\n               in promoting RS production (\nDavies\net\u00a0al.\n1982\n), and of regular exercise in nullifying these effects (reviewed in\nPowers\net\u00a0al.\n2004\n), has received considerable attention (\nAlessio 1993\n;\nDi Meo & Venditti 2001\n;\nGomez\u2010Cabrera, Domenech & Vi\u00f1a 2008\n). Although physical performance has been linked to aspects of organismal fitness,\n               specifically as a proxy for escape from predators (e.g. flight performance;\nVeasey, Metcalfe & Houston 1998\n), the effect of RS and role of AO in maintaining the redox balance during activity\n               remains unclear. Nonetheless, a diversity of ecologically relevant phenomena conducive\n               to this type of research exists, and clearly warrants further investigation. For example,\n               the expression of a number of physically demanding behaviours (e.g. migration, hunting,\n               predator escape, sexual displays) may be evolutionary shaped by OS.\nChanges in tissue oxygen levels can directly affect rates of OD, a phenomenon most\n               commonly studied in rodents, rabbits, dogs and pigs during ischaemia\u2010reperfusion as\n               a model for treating injuries in humans (e.g.\nAksoy\net\u00a0al.\n2004\n;\nHirayama\net\u00a0al.\n2005\n;\nOvechkin\net\u00a0al.\n2007\n). However, similar non\u2010pathological changes (e.g. ischaemia) can be found in natural\n               contexts, such as reanimation following estivation, torpor, or hibernation, recovery\n               from extracellular freezing, or temporally variable anoxia conditions commonly found\n               in both invertebrates and vertebrates (\nStorey 1996\n;\nWillmore & Storey 1997\n;\nBickler & Buck 2007\n;\nIssartel\net\u00a0al.\n2009\n;\nOrr\net\u00a0al.\n2009\n). Many of these organisms elevate AO levels during the oxygen\u2010limited state to limit\n               OD upon return to normoxia (\nStorey 1996\n;\nHermes\u2010Lima, Storey & Storey 1998\n).\nThere are also a variety of survival behaviours that are related to OS. For example,\n               degree of torpor decreases with an increased polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content\n               in the food hoard of chipmunks (\nTamias striatus\n;\nMunro, Thomas & Humphries 2005\n), possibly due to the susceptibility of PUFAs to oxidation. Perceived predation risk\n               also seems to have a direct influence on OS, as predator presence can increase oxygen\n               consumption and decrease levels of AO enzymes (\nSlos & Stoks 2008\n). Finally,\nBize\net\u00a0al.\n(2008)\nfound that male alpine swifts (\nApus melba\n) with red blood cells that were more resistant to an\nin vitro\nfree radical attack tended to have greater inter\u2010annual survival rates, providing\n               one of the first clear links between oxidative balance and survival in a wild animal.\nAnother component of survival is immunocompetence. The study of ecoimmunology has\n               proliferated in recent years, and a large number of studies have examined relationships\n               between AO (particularly carotenoids) and immunity (e.g.\nBlount\net\u00a0al.\n2003\n;\nCostantini & Dell\u2019Omo 2006\n;\nH\u00f5rak\net\u00a0al.\n2007\n). As this field has been reviewed elsewhere in an evolutionary context (\nDowling & Simmons 2009\n), we do not explore the relationship between RS and immune function in depth here.\n               Briefly, however, during an innate immune response, phagocytic cells use an oxidative\n               burst (RS production) to destroy pathogens. While these molecules effectively neutralize\n               bacterial invaders, they are non\u2010specific and may also destroy self\u2010tissue. Therefore,\n               individuals need to be able to negate the potential immunopathological effects of\n               an immune response to maintain the fitness\u2010related benefit of the immune response\n               (\nCostantini & M\u00f8ller 2009\n;\nSorci & Faivre 2009\n).\nSenescence\nSenescence is a process in which organisms undergo physiological degeneration with\n               age (\nRose 1991\n). OS has been linked to evolutionary theories of senescence since\nHarman (1956)\nfirst proposed the free radical theory of ageing, which suggests that cumulative\n               OD on cell constituents caused by free radicals produced during aerobic respiration\n               results in ageing and ultimately death. Since this time, the free radical theory has\n               been refined and a number of hypothetical iterations have been presented, including\n               the mitochondrial theory of ageing (\nHarman 1972\n) and the OS hypothesis of ageing (\nYu & Yang 1996\n;\nSohal, Mockett & Orr 2002\n). In 2003, Hulbert further developed the hypothesis and proposed the membrane pacemaker\n               theory of ageing, suggesting that it is variation in membrane fatty acid composition,\n               and the consequent differential vulnerability to lipid peroxidation, which determines\n               lifespan: cells richer in PUFA should be more susceptible to OD and will therefore\n               be more prone to cell senescence (\nHulbert 2003, 2005\n;\nHulbert\net\u00a0al.\n2007\n). There is considerable support for the free radical theory of ageing in a wide range\n               of taxa. However, much of this evidence is correlative and based on a limited number\n               of laboratory taxa; thus definitive proof that alterations in OS play a role in longevity\n               remains elusive (\nWickens 2001\n;\nSohal, Mockett & Orr 2002\n). Several recent, comprehensive reviews discuss the evidence for the broad free radical\n               theory of ageing in considerable detail (see\nBeckman & Ames 1998\n;\nAshok & Ali 1999\n;\nWickens 2001\n;\nSohal, Mockett & Orr 2002\n), and it is not our intention to review such evidence here; instead we present a\n               brief overview of the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate and discuss\n               the role of OS in this relationship.\nGiven that RS production is partly a function of metabolic rate (i.e. a higher metabolic\n               rate should lead to greater RS production), the free radical theory of ageing is often\n               thought of synonymously with the rate of living theory: species with higher basal\n               metabolic rates (BMR) are suggested to have shorter maximum lifespan potential (MLSP)\n               as a result of increased RS production (\nBeckman & Ames 1998\n;\nDowling & Simmons 2009\n). However, this integrated theory is somewhat erroneous. While there is some empirical\n               support for a relationship between MLSP and BMR (e.g. birds,\nCohen\net\u00a0al.\n2008\n; humans,\nRuggiero\net\u00a0al.\n2008\n), many studies show no relationship between mortality and BMR (e.g. microchiropteran\n               bats,\nFilho\net\u00a0al.\n2007\n; colubrid snakes,\nRobert, Brunet\u2010Rossinni & Bronikowski 2007\n; zebra finches\nTaeniopygia guttata\n,\nMoe\net\u00a0al.\n2009\n). In addition, several statistical and methodological issues appear to compromise\n               the validity of much of the data supporting this hypothesis; though, at least in one\n               study of small mammals, when these issues are eliminated and a more robust measure\n               of daily energy expenditure is employed (e.g. elimination rates of stable isotopes\n               as opposed to BMR), high energy expenditure remains associated with shorter lifespan\n               (\nSpeakman\net\u00a0al.\n2002\n). Finally, BMR does not appear to be a good predictor of lifespan within a species.\n               For example, experimental manipulation of energy expenditure via cold exposure does\n               not shorten lifespan in field voles (\nMicrotus agrestis\n;\nSelman\net\u00a0al.\n2008\n). Moreover, in mice, lifespan is not affected by an increase in energy expenditure\n               induced by either cold exposure (\nVaanholt\net\u00a0al.\n2009\n) or aerobic exercise (\nVaanholt\net\u00a0al.\n2010\n).\nOne reason for these mixed results appears to be an uncoupling between metabolism\n               and OS. Specifically, the transition of mitochondria from state 4 (resting) to state\n               3 (respiratory active, producing ATP) is not accompanied by a proportionate increase\n               of free radical production (\nLoschen, Floh\u00e9 & Chance 1971\n). Consequently, OD cannot be massive during phases of increased metabolic rate because\n               the mitochondrial free radical leak strongly decreases over the states 4 to 3 transition\n               (\nHerrero & Barja 1997\n). This uncoupling between metabolism and OS appears to be influenced by uncoupling\n               proteins (\nCriscuolo\net\u00a0al.\n2005\n) and likely represents an important biochemical adaptation to OS. Importantly, this\n               uncoupling can result in a positive relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan\n               (\u2018uncoupling to survive hypothesis\u2019\nBrand 2000\n;\nSpeakman\net al.\n2002\n). However, we suggest that more studies on the link between metabolic rate and RS\n               production/OD (especially among wild animals and understudied taxonomic groups) are\n               necessary to understand if this uncoupling is a general rule or occurs only under\n               certain circumstances. Finally, we recommend further empirical studies of the link\n               between BMR (or daily energy expenditure) and lifespan, but suggest that such studies\n               should incorporate a wider range of taxa and might be best addressed in long\u2010lived\n               organisms or organisms that withstand environmental extremes (e.g. bristlecone pine,\nPinus longaeva\n, MLSP >4500\u2003years,\nLanner & Connor 2001\n; periodical cicadas,\nMagicicada\n; Iceland clam,\nArctica islandica\n, MLSP >400\u2003years,\nButtemer, Adele & Costantini 2010\n; waved albatross,\nDiomedea irrorata\n; estivating snails or anoxia\u2010tolerant turtles, see\nStorey 1996\n).\nReproduction\nOS may have its most dramatic effect on animal fitness by directly impairing reproduction\n               (\nHarshman & Zera 2007\n). Age\u2010specific accumulation of OS has been shown to damage oocytes and embryos of\n               mammal mothers later in life (\nTar\u00edn 1996\n), but in many taxa, OS can also have age\u2010independent reproductive detriments. For\n               example, mating increases susceptibility to OS in virgin female\nDrosophila melanogaster\n(\nRush\net\u00a0al.\n2007\n). In domesticated zebra finches, two reproductive phenomena \u2013 a greater number of\n               breeding bouts per lifetime (\nAlonso\u2010Alvarez\net\u00a0al.\n2006\n) and raising more offspring per breeding bout (\nAlonso\u2010Alvarez\net\u00a0al.\n2004\n;\nWiersma\net\u00a0al.\n2004\n) \u2013 reduce AO defences. Some nutrients like carotenoids, however, seem to be able\n               to modulate reproduction and trade\u2010offs with other life\u2010history aspects like OS resistance\n               (e.g. birds,\nBiard, Surai & M\u00f8ller 2005\n;\nBertrand\net\u00a0al.\n2006\n; mollusks,\nPetes, Menge & Harris 2008\n). Maintaining a positive seasonal carotenoid balance also predicts reproductive success\n               in wild barn swallows (\nHirundo rustica\n,\nSafran\net\u00a0al.\n2010\n). In contrast to emphases on AO, only a handful of studies have investigated OS and\n               female reproduction in wild animals (see\nde Almedia\net\u00a0al.\n2007\nfor a review in marine bivalves). In a wild, long\u2010lived avian species (alpine swifts),\n               number of eggs laid per attempt (clutch size) was positively correlated with resistance\n               of red blood cells to an\nin vitro\nfree radical attack (\nBize\net\u00a0al.\n2008\n). However, in a wild, long\u2010lived mammal (soay sheep,\nOvis aries\n), lipid peroxidation was unrelated to recent and past reproductive effort (\nNussey\net\u00a0al.\n2009\n).\nSome aspects of parental care (e.g. nestling food provisioning in birds,\nHelfenstein\net\u00a0al.\n2008\n; egg fanning in fish,\nPike\net\u00a0al.\n2007\n) may also be linked to parental AO status. Given the high growth and metabolic rates\n               in developing young, it is not surprising that OS strongly influences offspring; for\n               example,\nCostantini\net\u00a0al.\n(2006)\nfound that nestling Eurasian kestrels (\nFalco tinnunculus\n) from larger broods experience higher level of OS. Pre\u2010natal OS can even induce neural\n               damage and cognitive function in young rats (\nSong\net\u00a0al.\n2009\n). There is also significant interest in how OS impacts fertility in human females\n               (\nAgarwal, Gupta & Sharma 2005\n). OS can affect early (e.g. oocyte maturation) and late (e.g. pre\u2010eclampsia, pre\u2010term\n               labour) stages of the female reproductive cycle, and various dietary interventions\n               (e.g. vitamin supplementation) have been implemented before and during pregnancy.\n               In most cases, however, either pre\u2010embryonic or post\u2010hatch/birth OS is studied in\n               isolation; we encourage more comprehensive studies across life\u2010history stages to better\n               understand how OS is transmitted from mother to offspring and which sources are more\n               significant for long\u2010term offspring survival and reproduction. Additionally, investigation\n               of the role of OS in transgenerational effects that are not the result of genetic\n               origin or developmental environment may help us understand if these effects \u2018program\u2019\n               offspring for the future environment or if they simply function as a constraint on\n               phenotypic plasticity (\nJablonka & Raz 2009\n). Finally, we recommend expanding tests of these AO/OS ideas to new taxa, including\n               organisms that are semelparous, very long\u2010lived (and thus infrequently breeding),\n               and that live under extreme environmental conditions (e.g. crowded, inbred, thermal\n               extremes), to permit robust examination of how various reproductive stages and tactics\n               are influenced by oxidative balance.\nSexual ornamentation\nMany animals put substantial energy into developing and maintaining secondary sexual\n               traits (e.g. colours, songs, antlers), whose expression may be shaped by AO and OS\n               in a number of ways (\nSheldon & Verhulst 1996\n;\nvon Schantz\net\u00a0al.\n1999\n). Carotenoid\u2010based sexual traits have commanded particular attention in this area\n               because carotenoid molecules function both as colorants (\nMcGraw 2006\n) and immunostimulants (e.g.\nBlount\net\u00a0al.\n2003\n), with potential for AO activity via RS scavenging (\nKrinsky 2001\n; but see\nCostantini & M\u00f8ller 2008\n). Consequently, individuals may face an allocation trade\u2010off between investment in\n               ornamentation vs. immunocompetence (\nLozano 1994\n;\nOlson & Owens 1998\n), a hypothesis for which there is some empirical support (e.g.\nFaivre\net\u00a0al.\n2003\n;\nAlonso\u2010Alvarez\net\u00a0al.\n2004\n;\nClotfelter, Ardia & McGraw 2007\n).\nOS has also been suggested to mediate the trade\u2010off between health and other forms\n               of ornamentation. Specifically, ornaments, from fleshy combs and wattles to feathers\n               and spurs, are proposed to be sensitive to OS, such that production of RS resulting\n               from immune system activation leads to reduced ornamentation (\nvon Schantz\net\u00a0al.\n1999\n). However, studies examining whether immune activation induces OS, and those examining\n               the relationship between OS and ornamentation, provide mixed support for this hypothesis\n               (\nCostantini & Dell\u2019Omo 2006\n;\nH\u00f5rak\net\u00a0al.\n2006\n;\nTorres & Veldano 2007\n;\nGalv\u00e1n & Alonso\u2010Alvarez 2008\n;\nIsaksson & Andersson 2008\n).\nSperm performance\nSperm cells appear to be particularly vulnerable to attack by RS due to their high\n               PUFA content and metabolic activity (\nSikka 2001\n;\nSurai\net\u00a0al.\n2001\n). In humans and a limited number of domesticated animals, RS attack has been shown\n               to induce a lipid peroxidation chain event that can lead to decreased motility and\n               viability, and an inability to fuse with the oocyte (\nFujihara & Howarth 1978\n;\nWishart 1984\n;\nAitken, Clarkson & Fishel 1989\n;\ndeLamirande & Gagnon 1992\n;\nBaumber\net\u00a0al.\n2000\n;\nBilodeau\net\u00a0al.\n2002\n). Importantly, RS may also damage nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of sperm, with negative\n               consequences for fertilizing capacity and post\u2010fertilization embryo survival (\nAitken & Krausz 2001\n). Sperm are also subject to RS attack in the testes, resulting in impaired steroidogenesis,\n               a reduced capacity to differentiate normal spermatozoa, and, ultimately, a reduction\n               in sperm fertilizing ability (\nWu\net\u00a0al.\n1973\n;\nAitken & Roman 2008\n). Thus, OS can have a significant impact on male fitness, and may influence a number\n               of evolutionary processes including the evolution of polyandry and mating strategies,\n               sexual conflict, and sperm competition dynamics (\nSiva\u2010Jothy 2000\n;\nDean, Bonsall & Pizzari 2007\n;\nPizzari\net\u00a0al.\n2008\n;\nDowling & Simmons 2009\n).\nBoth sperm and seminal plasma possess AO systems that protect sperm from RS\u2010induced\n               OS. Specifically, SOD, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase appear to be the major\n               semen AO in a range of taxa, with additional protection provided by vitamins C and\n               E, ubiquinols, and glutathione (\nSikka 2001\n;\nSurai\net\u00a0al.\n2001\n;\nWeirich, Collins & Williams 2002\n). Dietary carotenoid supplementation is associated with improved sperm quality (presumably\n               via prevention of RS\u2010induced damage) in humans (\nGupta & Kumar 2002\n) and fishes (\nAhmadi\net\u00a0al.\n2006\n;\nPike\net\u00a0al.\n2010\n). Furthermore, carotenoids are present in the ejaculates of birds (\nRowe & McGraw 2008\n) and insects (\nHeller, Fleischmann & Lutz\u2010R\u00f6der 2000\n), suggesting the AO role of carotenoids in semen deserves further research. Future\n               investigations should also focus on the relative contribution of each AO type to total\n               AO capacity of semen, and examine how these metrics covary with sperm performance.\nThe impact of OS may be particularly important in species with high levels of sperm\n               competition. In these species, males with a greater capacity to defend sperm against\n               OS should gain a greater share of paternity. Consequently, sexual selection may target\n               cellular mechanisms underlying sperm function aimed at avoiding OS. In a recent comparative\n               study of\nMus\nspecies, the level of sperm competition was associated with rapid changes in protamine\n               2 genes, which, in turn, appear to be associated with the efficiency of DNA compaction\n               (\nMartin\u2010Coello\net\u00a0al.\n2009\n). In sperm nuclei, protamine\u2010induced DNA compaction protects DNA from double\u2010strand\n               breaks by reducing the ability of RS to access DNA (\nSuzuki\net\u00a0al.\n2009\n), suggesting that the rapid changes observed in\nMus\nspecies may reflect selection for increased resistance to RS\u2010induced sperm DNA damage.\n               Similarly, protective mechanisms aimed at preventing OD to sperm structures may have\n               evolved in response to sperm competition, though these ideas remain largely unexplored.\nAO defences aimed at minimizing OD to sperm should also be particularly important\n               for species with prolonged sperm storage. Stored sperm (i.e. aged sperm) show reduced\n               fertilizing success (\nTar\u00edn, P\u00e9rez\u2010Albal\u00e1 & Cano 2000\n;\nWagner, Helfenstein & Danchin 2004\n), which can impact female reproductive success, generate sexual conflict and influence\n               behaviour (e.g. sperm ejection, re\u2010mating strategies;\nSiva\u2010Jothy 2000\n;\nDean, Bonsall & Pizzari 2007\n). To date, studies of AO in the sperm storage organs of females are limited to a\n               few species of agricultural importance (i.e. poultry,\nBr\u00e8que, Surai & Brillard 2003\n; bees,\nCollins, Williams & Evans 2004\n). However, a wide range of taxa show extended periods of sperm storage (e.g. bats,\n               up to 198\u2003days; reptiles, up to 2555\u2003days;\nBirkhead & M\u00f8ller 1993\n), and future studies utilizing these species should provide substantial insight into\n               the biological significance of OS\u2010related sperm deterioration in wild organisms. Perhaps\n               the most exciting potential study systems can be found among the insects: in some\n               species, females maintain viable populations of stored sperm for periods as long as\n               thirty years (e.g. narrow\u2010headed ant\nFormica exsecta\n,\nPamilo 1991\n). Male extragonadal sperm stores may also experience RS\u2010induced deterioration with\n               important consequences for fitness (\nTar\u00edn, P\u00e9rez\u2010Albal\u00e1 & Cano 2000\n) and male behaviour (e.g. sperm wastage;\nPizzari\net\u00a0al.\n2008\n). Finally, OS and AO may modulate the relationship between male sexual ornamentation\n               and sperm quality and allow females to choose reproductive partners with high functional\n               fertility (\nBlount, M\u00f8ller & Houston 2001\n;\nVelando, Torres & Alonso\u2010Alvarez 2008\n); for example more colourful males appear better able to protect their sperm from\n               OS in both birds (\nHelfenstein\net\u00a0al.\n2010\n) and fishes (\nPike\net\u00a0al.\n2010\n).\nThe production of RS in semen may also provide a range of beneficial effects for sperm\n               function, including the ability to achieve and sustain hyperactivation and the promotion\n               of capacitation (\ndeLamirande & Gagnon 1993\n;\nZini, deLamirande & Gagnon 1995\n). Although these initial studies were performed\nin vitro\nwith human sperm and the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear, these\n               reports demonstrate that RS are not always detrimental to the fertilization process.\n               Therefore, understanding the balance between the beneficial and harmful effects of\n               RS and the balance between RS production and AO defences is integral to understanding\n               sperm function. Future ecological studies can benefit by avoiding the oversimplification\n               of RS as purely detrimental and investigating these other potential roles of RS in\n               species with different mating strategies, modes of fertilization (internal vs. external\n               fertilizers), or fertilization environments (marine vs. terrestrial spawners). Finally,\n               as the majority of studies concerning OS in semen have been performed\nin vitro\nand in the fields of human infertility and poultry semen cryopreservation, future\n               research across a wider range of taxa (as suggested above) may provide a clearer picture\n               of the influence of OS on gametic performance and individual fitness.\nConclusions\nEven at this early stage of investigation, it is evident that AO availability and\n            OS can be ecologically relevant selection pressures linked to organismal survival\n            and reproduction. However, the complexity of mechanisms underlying the physiology\n            of RS and AO, combined with the dominance of lab studies and paucity of studies on\n            free\u2010ranging organisms, makes it difficult to draw broad ecological and evolutionary\n            conclusions at this time. It is also becoming clear that different taxa may respond\n            to the same environmental perturbations in very different ways. Therefore, it is important\n            to take into account the characteristics of the species under study and to be conservative\n            in claiming the ability of any species to function as a model for understanding the\n            great diversity of comparative OS physiology.\nWe believe that a useful way to think about the emergence and impact of the field\n            of AO and OS ecology is to draw from another physiological subdiscipline, specifically\n            the interface between endocrinology and ecology (e.g.\nKetterson\net\u00a0al.\n1996\n). Similar to hormones, AO can be sensitive to numerous stressors, highly labile within\n            and among organisms over space and time, and challenging to manipulate. However, the\n            insights gained by taking endocrinological approaches to phenotypic development, ornament\n            expression, territory defence, and a host of other life history questions have proven\n            invaluable to the study of ecology. By investigating the roles of RS, AO, and OS with\n            the same rigour that ecologists have used in evaluating hormonal causes and consequences,\n            we will be able to ask new questions concerning life\u2010history traits at the individual,\n            population, and community levels. Additionally, the ubiquity of similar AO defences\n            in widely dissimilar organisms (cf. many hormone systems), allows biologists to ask\n            broad evolutionary and ecological questions, such as those surrounding survival\u2010reproduction\n            trade\u2010offs. Evolutionary endocrinologists have recently investigated such a question\n            and found robust evidence of selection on hormones as a function of annual survival,\n            within\u2010pair siring success and extra\u2010pair mating success (\nMcGlothlin\net\u00a0al.\n2010\n). If functional ecologists develop methodologies to manipulate and measure AO or\n            OS levels, we may also be able to more concretely investigate causal mechanisms regarding\n            constraints on life\u2010history strategies, expression of sexual ornaments, and rates\n            of both individual and sperm senescence. In conclusion, future research that investigates\n            longer\u2010term, integrated measures of OD, AO, and OS across a wide range of taxa from\n            a variety of ecological niches will help to elucidate the extent to which these factors\n            are important selective pressures under wild conditions.\nAcknowledgements\nDuring manuscript preparation, DC was supported by a postdoctoral NERC research fellowship\n            (NE/G013888/1).

Children diagnosed with\n            AD that was considered difficult to treat, aged between 8 and 18 years and willing to\n            be treated in Switzerland were randomized to a six\u2010week personalized integrative multidisciplinary\n            treatment period in a clinical setting in the alpine climate (Switzerland) or an outpatient\n            setting in moderate maritime climate (Netherlands). Study assessments were conducted\n            at the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital; an electronic portal was used for the collection\n            of questionnaire data. Primary outcomes were disease activity (SAEASI), quality of life (CDLQI) and catastrophizing thoughts (JUCKKI/JU) 6 months after intervention. Other assessments were immediately and 6 weeks after\n            intervention. Subgroup analyses concerned asthma\u2010related outcomes. Children were randomly\n            assigned to either the intervention or control group using a covariate adaptive randomization\n            method, taking age and asthma diagnosis into account. Children, parents and healthcare\n            professionals involved in treatment were not blinded to group assignment. Data were\n            analysed according to intention\u2010to\u2010treat with linear mixed\u2010effects models for continuous\n            outcomes. The trial is registered at Current Controlled Trials ISCRTN88136485.\nResults\nBetween 14 September 2010 and 30 September 2014, 88 children were enrolled in the\n            trial, 84 children were randomized (41 assigned to intervention, 43 to control) of\n            whom 77 completed the intervention (38 of 41 (93%) intervention, 39 of 43 (91%) control)\n            and 74 completed follow\u2010up (38 of 41 (93%) intervention, 36 of 43 (84%) control).\n            Six months after intervention there were no significant differences between the groups\n            on disease activity (SAEASI mean difference \u22123.4 (95%CI \u22128.5 to 1.7)), quality of life (CDLQI mean difference \u20100.3 (95%CI \u22122.0 to 1.4)) and catastrophizing thoughts (JUCCKI/JU subscale mean difference \u22120.7 (95%CI \u22121.4 to \u22120.0)). Immediately and 6 weeks after intervention, disease activity and\n            quality of life were significantly different in favour of alpine climate treatment.\n            Mean differences on SAEASI were \u221210.1 (95%CI \u221214.5 to \u22125.8) and \u22128.4 (95%CI \u221212.2 to \u22124.6) and on CDLQI \u22121.9 (95%CI \u22123.3 to \u22120.5) and \u22121.5 (95%CI \u22122.8 to \u22120.3) immediately and 6 weeks after the intervention, respectively. There\n            were no long\u2010term differences on asthma\u2010related outcomes. Five serious adverse events\n            occurred during the study period, which were not thought to be related to the treatment.\nConclusions & Clinical relevance\nFor children with difficult to treat AD, there was no additional long\u2010term benefit of alpine climate treatment, in contrast\n            to the short\u2010term, compared to an outpatient treatment programme in moderate maritime\n            climate, using a personalized integrative multidisciplinary treatment approach.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

Much of this is based on principles derived from psychometric theory and assumes\n            that the individual items form parallel tests, so that simple weighted or unweighted\n            summation is an appropriate method of aggregation. More recent work either continues\n            to promulgate these methods or places emphasis on modern techniques centred on item\n            response theory. In fact, however, clinical measuring instruments often have different\n            underlying principles, so adopting such approaches is inappropriate. We illustrate,\n            using health\u2010related quality of life, that clinimetric and psychometric ideas need\n            to be combined to yield a suitable measuring instrument. We note the fundamental distinction\n            between indicator and causal variables and propose that this distinction suffices\n            to explain fully the need for both clinimetric and psychometric techniques, and identifies\n            their respective roles in scale development, validation and scoring.\n1.\u2003Introduction\nMany multi\u2010item scales are used in medicine and psychology. Examples may be found\n            in all branches of medicine. Their use is even more frequent in psychology, reflecting\n            the fact that many psychological attributes cannot be directly observed or measured.\n            The principles of scale design and development are well documented, and many books\n            describe methods of item selection, content validation, criterion validation, construct\n            validation, reliability assessment, scaling and analysis (e.g.\n37\n),\n45\n) and\n57\n)). Most of the techniques take their origins in psychometrics and the social sciences,\n            where researchers such as\n36\n),\n26\n),\n12\n) and\n56\n) developed scales for assessing intelligence, personality, educational attainment,\n            mood states, opinion, ability and so on. These names are commemorated in the eponymous\n            scales, coefficients and tests that continue to feature so prominently in statistics\n            and psychometrics. The common feature of these techniques is that there are assumed\n            to be one or more underlying psychological concepts, frequently described as\nconstructs\n, that are not directly measurable. The postulated constructs are often termed\nlatent variables\n. The above measurement techniques constitute what is now commonly termed the\ntraditional psychometric approach\nto scaling. In this approach, the scores on the items in a measurement scale are\n            regarded as continuous variates that reflect (with error) the subject's level on that\n            concept for which a measure is desired. This leads to methods that are equivalent\n            to linear models. Standard methodological books on the subject still tend to be associated\n            with psychometrics, intelligence testing, personality testing and education, although\n            the same methods are widely used whenever a multi\u2010item instrument is developed.\nMore recently, modern psychometrics has adopted a probabilistic approach to the development\n            of scales, and this has led to an increasing emphasis on\nitem response theory\n(IRT) as the framework for the development of measurement scales (\n29\n;\n45\n). In contrast with the traditional approach, IRT adopts the perspective that higher\n            levels of the latent variable are reflected by an increased probability that the subject\n            will respond positively to each item. Since responses to most items are either dichotomous\n            (e.g. `right' or `wrong' in educational tests) or ordered categorical (e.g. severity\n            level of a mood state), this leads to models in which each of the multiple items in\n            a measurement scale follow logistic (binary or ordinal) models.\nAll of the above is all very well, but in both clinical medicine and health\u2010related\n            quality\u2010of\u2010life (QOL) research many scales include a less homogeneous set of items\n            than are found in psychometric tests, such as symptoms of disease and side\u2010effects\n            of treatment. An example is tumour staging in cancer, which is based on cancer site\u2010specific\n            combinations of\nT\n(tumour) stage,\nN\n(nodal) stage and\nM\n(metastases) (\n31\n). An earlier example is the Apgar score, measuring the state of health of newborn\n            infants, which is based on a combination of disparate items, including body colour,\n            heart rate, respiration, reflex response and muscle tone (\n2\n). Feinstein called such scales\nclinimetric\n(\n22\n) and subsequently wrote a highly influential book on the same title (Feinstein, 1987b).\n            He defined clinimetrics to refer to\n`arbitrary ratings, scales, indexes, instruments or other expressions that have been\n                  created as \u201cmeasurements\u201d for those clinical phenomena that cannot be measured in\n                  the customary dimensions of laboratory data'.\nFeinstein argued that the aim of psychometricians is to create scales in which the\n            multiple component items are all measuring more or less the same single attribute,\n            but that this is in contrast with the aim of clinicians, which is to choose and emphasize\n            suitably the most important attributes to be included in the index, using multiple\n            items which are not expected to be homogeneous because they indicate different aspects\n            of a complex clinical phenomenon. Thus there are two types of scale,\npsychometric\nand\nclinimetric\n, with different aims, and hence their development should follow different paths.\nIn fact, there is also a third type. The above two types might both be characterized\n            as\ninternal\n. Although they may aim to quantify a condition or to predict future outcomes, there\n            is no gold standard measurement representing the true value of the outcome. Internal\n            scales are either based on theoretical models for the underlying process or represent\n            indices that serve as definition of the outcome measure. In contrast, an\nexternal\nscale will be constructed on the basis that it is a good predictor of some measurable\n            gold standard or future state. External measurement scales need not be based on a\n            theoretical model. Instead, an empirical model is chosen purely on the basis of its\n            predictive power. An example is the prediction of cure or survival from clinical prognostic\n            factors models. For pragmatic reasons weighted sums are often used, derived from regression\n            analysis. Of course, the difficulty with this approach is that an observable gold\n            standard is required, to provide a dependent variable that is to be predicted. Without\n            such a gold standard we are forced to fall back on internal approaches, based solely\n            on the relationships between the items that have been measured (the psychometric approach)\n            or on the required relationships between the observed items and the attribute for\n            which an index is being defined (the clinimetric approach). We shall not be concerned\n            with external scales here.\nThe two internal approaches, psychometric and clinimetric, result in scales containing\n            different items. There continues to be much debate about which should be the preferred\n            approach, and about how to choose between the approaches. In this paper we argue that\n            some items should be regarded as `causal' variables, and that this distinction accounts\n            for the differences between psychometric and clinimetric scales, and the need for\n            both. Awareness of causal variables will enable investigators to select the appropriate\n            approach for the development of scales and explains the seemingly strange differences\n            that have been observed by those who have made empirical comparisons of the two approaches.\nWe first illustrate typical problems by using a few published examples, and we shall\n            examine these throughout the paper.\n2.\u2003Examples\n2.1.\u2003Example 1: construction of questionnaires\u2014a retrospective study\nThe initial stages of the development of a questionnaire consist of first generating\n               a comprehensive pool of potential items, and then selecting items from the pool for\n               the final questionnaire.\n34\n) developed an asthma QOL questionnaire and contrasted psychometric methods, in particular\n               factor analysis, against a clinimetric approach using patients' opinions of importance\n               (`impact').\nPsychometric analysis resulted in a 36\u2010item instrument, compared with 32 items by\n               the impact method. Only 20 items were common to both. The impact method was chosen\n               for the final instrument, on grounds that this corresponded to clinical sensibility.\n               The psychometric method would have excluded three items of greatest importance to\n               patients, and other items relating to important functional impairment would have been\n               omitted; some arguably less important psychological items would have been included.\n34\n) commented\n`We believe that all items of functional impairment that are important to patients,\n                     irrespective of their association with each other, should be included in a disease\u2010specific\n                     quality of life instrument and therefore we use the impact method'.\n2.2.\u2003Example 2: construction of questionnaires\u2014a prospective study\n38\n) carried out a study to construct a disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand scale,\n               using clinimetric and psychometric techniques including factor analysis, Cronbach's\n               \u03b1 and the exploration of correlation coefficients. They found that the clinimetric\n               approach selected predominantly symptom items, whereas the psychometric method resulted\n               in almost exclusively physical disability items. They commented `this research confirms\n               the results of Juniper\net\u2003al\n. \u2026 in a parallel, prospective, and blinded fashion' and suggested that `perhaps a\n               combination of both methods may provide clinicians with the most appropriate scales'.\n2.3.\u2003Example 3: instrument validation\nThe Rotterdam symptom checklist was until the mid\u20101990s a widely used QOL instrument\n               for cancer clinical trials.\n19\n) reported seven trials and studies that used factor analysis to validate the scale\n               structure of the Rotterdam symptom checklist. We found that there was agreement between\n               researchers that the first factor represents general psychological distress and is\n               a broad average of psychological problems, whereas the other factors are a combination\n               of physical symptoms and side\u2010effects. There was a considerable divergence of opinion\n               about details of these physical subscales, and dispute about both the total number\n               of factors and which items should be combined in the factors, with claims that there\n               are two, four, five, seven or even nine factors.\nUsing data from a UK Medical Research Council clinical trial for colorectal cancer,\n               we applied factor analysis and obtained a four\u2010factor solution. In common with other\n               studies, the first factor was general psychological distress. However, the second\n               factor, a general `symptom' factor, contained a seemingly strange combination of items\u2014including\n               `lack of appetite', `decreased sexual interest' and `dry mouth'\u2014and was completely\n               different from the second factors reported by others. In our case, the other two factors\n               were nausea and vomiting, and pain or aches. Thus we confirmed that factor analysis\n               of the Rotterdam symptom checklist results in seemingly strange factor structure that\n               varies from study to study.\n2.4.\u2003Example 4: construction of scales\n6\n,\n5\n) reported the validation of a QOL module for patients with head and neck cancers,\n               European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ\u2010H&N35. Psychometric\n               `scaling analysis' revealed a few scaling errors:\n`The main problem was the item about painful throat. From a clinical perspective,\n                     it was understandable that this item had a higher correlation with the Swallowing\n                     Scale. However, \u2026 it was decided for clinical reasons to leave this item in the Pain\n                     Scale.'\nAlso, some scales had low Cronbach's \u03b1:\n`Some scales in the current module consist of items assessing different but related\n                     clinical aspects, such as the items in the Speech and Social Contact Scale. The aggregation\n                     of these items is based upon clinical grounds more than on psychometric theory. The\n                     reason for such subscale construction is the need for clinically sensible summary\n                     scores\u2014not necessarily to make a scale with better internal reliability.'\nThey concluded:\n`Most of the scales represent clinical scales, in which the items \u201chang together\u201d\n                     in a clinically sensible manner, but they are not necessarily highly correlated. Internal\n                     consistency with high Cronbach's \u03b1 is not so relevant in such scales.'\n3.\u2003Indicator variables and causal variables\nThe majority of the items to be found in personality tests, intelligence tests, educational\n            tests and other psychometric assessments\nreflect\na level of ability or a state of mind. This has two implications. Firstly, implicit\n            in this approach is the notion that the `thing' being measured exists\u2014we are not merely\n            defining it in terms of the variables that we choose to measure (and combine in some\n            way), but each of these variables is assumed to have some relationship to an underlying\n            concept which we are trying to measure. (Of course, the measure of the underlying\n            concept can only be defined in terms of the variables that we have measured, but that\n            is a different issue and is merely a reflection of the inadequacy of our collection\n            of measured variables.) Secondly, the items do not alter or influence the underlying\n            concept: they are merely aspects of it, or indicators of its magnitude. Such items\n            have been given various names, including `effect indicators' and `manifest response\n            variables'. We shall simply call them\nindicator variables\n.\nIn contrast, many scales from other fields, such as QOL scales, are not constrained\n            to include merely indicator variables. They\ncan\ninclude such variables, but they can (and typically do) also include variables which\n            are part of the definition of what the concept being measured means. These measurements\n            are very similar to the\noperational\nmeasurements of\n30\n). This also has two implications. Firstly, it means that sometimes we are defining\n            the thing being measured in terms of the variables that we select to measure it. In\n            contrast with the psychometric approach, we are not postulating that something exists\n            but are merely constructing an index which is convenient for some purpose. The variables,\n            therefore, need not be indicator variables for the concept in question. It follows\n            from this, and this is the second implication, that we can, in some sense, frequently\n            regard these variables as `causal' since, if they are present (score highly, say)\n            then the concept in question is present. Thus, in the case of QOL, a scale might include\n            a measurement of pain as a component\u2014not a result of low QOL, but a likely cause of\n            it. Similarly, symptoms of a disease (while, perhaps, being indicator variables for\n            that disease) or side\u2010effects of a treatment could have an adverse effect on QOL.\n            Clearly the symptoms and the side\u2010effects are not indicator variables for QOL: they\n            are not aspects of it, and they need not be present for low QOL to manifest itself.\n            But if they are present then it is likely that the patient will have a low QOL score.\n            Given all of this, it seems appropriate to characterize these as\ncausal variables\n. In what follows we shall use a disease symptom as an example of a causal variable\n            for low QOL.\nThe terms `causal indicator' and `effect indicator' are widely used in the field of\n            structural equation modelling (\n8\n). For us, however, these terms are not ideal\u2014which is why we have dropped the word\n            `effect'. In general, effects are the consequences of causes, but in our situation\n            our `indicator' variables need not be consequences of the latent variable being measured\n            but reflect aspects of it. They are fundamental to it, not necessarily consequences\n            of it.\nThe field of structural equation modelling uses path diagrams to display the relationships\n            between the variables, and to show the distinction between causal variables and indicator\n            variables. However, the implications of this distinction have been slow to filter\n            through to papers concerning the development of scales. Furthermore, papers that apply\n            structural equation modelling to QOL instruments have only recently mentioned causal\n            relationships (\n52\n;\n43\n;\n51\n) and have not recognized the additional problems that are posed by sufficient causes,\n            as described below.\n\u2014\u2014(\n) seminal book on clinimetrics neither explores the concept of causal relationships\n            nor lists such words as `cause' or `causal' in its index.\nAlthough much of this paper describes `models' of one kind or another, we must not\n            forget that our ultimate aim is to produce an instrument that will yield a score.\n            That is, we want to be able to combine the values of measured variables, preferably\n            in a relatively simple way, to yield an index of (in our case) QOL.\n3.1.\u2003Examples\nIn example 1, the items of functional impairment were described as being important\n               to patients and having `impact' on them; these items were implicitly being regarded\n               as causal, although that term was not used in\n34\n).\nIn example 3, the second factor for the Medical Research Council data contained items\n               for lack of appetite, decreased sexual interest and dry mouth\u2014all of which are common\n               symptoms of interferon treatment, and all likely to affect a patient's QOL. Thus they\n               are likely to be causal variables, as are items of the third factor (nausea and vomiting)\n               and fourth factor (pain or aches). The first factor, general psychological distress,\n               is more plausibly a combination of indicator variables, reflecting the patient's current\n               level of QOL.\nIn example 4, the pain scale was being defined by components such as `painful throat',\n               and the authors recognized that this was a summary index, noting `the need for clinically\n               sensible summary scores'.\n4.\u2003Necessary and sufficient component causes\nThe distinction between indicator and causal variables has various implications for\n            the way that we construct our measuring instruments. Sometimes the presence of just\n            one of the causal variables may by itself serve to produce the outcome value: it can\n            be a\nsufficient component cause\n.\nFor example, most patients who experience severe pain may as a consequence report\n            a poorer QOL, and thus pain may be a sufficient cause for poor QOL. However, patients\n            without any pain but who have other severe symptoms may also have a similarly poor\n            QOL. Pain is thus an example of a sufficient but not necessary cause of reduced QOL.\n            In general, a patient may suffer from one or more of several symptoms or side\u2010effects,\n            each of which may be regarded as causal for low QOL. This means that a QOL instrument\n            should be such that a score on any one of the causal variables leads to a low QOL\n            score.\nIn epidemiology the notion of causal variables is highly developed. In particular,\n53\n) is a classic paper on causes, introducing the concept of necessary and sufficient\n            causes. These concepts are well understood in the epidemiological context, but there\n            are two limitations in adopting the results for our purposes. Firstly, most statistical\n            theory that has been developed by epidemiologists for causal models has focused on\n            probabilistic binary outcomes, such as the risk of catching an infection or other\n            disease. Secondly, the priority in epidemiological research is establishing causal\n            mechanisms (aetiology) from a multitude of candidate risk factors. This is very different\n            from choosing potential causes to include in a single index measure. Moreover, tests\n            of a multicausal hypothesis predominate. After identifying causes, both necessary\n            and/or sufficient, the interest then becomes that of estimating the contribution of\n            each cause to the overall relative risk of the observed outcome (\n\u2014\u2014(\n). This also is very different from the aim in the development of scales, where the\n            objective is to determine a level for a single outcome measure such as QOL.\nFor the development of clinical scales, we are primarily concerned with sufficient\n            component causes. Necessary causes are rarely relevant. For QOL, any one of a number\n            of serious symptoms may be sufficient to cause poor overall QOL. More commonly, several\n            symptoms may form components of the net QOL reduction. However, it has been noted\n`should the component cause model give an accurate description of causation, many\n                  of the most popular statistical techniques would have to be revised. They build upon\n                  assumptions of additivity or multiplicability which only occasionally will be expected\n                  to fit the model. Furthermore, they focus upon estimating very simple and reduced\n                  summary statements which are quite irrelevant\u2026'\n(\n47\n). Thus the concept of component causes leads to an entirely different procedure for\n            creating summary scores. This can be illustrated by considering an artificial example.\n            As we noted earlier, most clinical and psychometric scales use simple summated scores\n            (or, equivalently, averages). Suppose that two factors, pain and vomiting, are each\n            sufficient causes for explaining a reduced QOL. For each factor an independent function\n            can be derived expressing its relationship to overall QOL. Then a logical scoring\n            system might be the maximum of the pain function and the vomiting function, rather\n            than their sum which would dilute a single high score by the presence of other lower\n            scores. In practice, most symptoms are likely to be component causes that can combine\n            and interact in various ways, and we are confronted by the problem of how to use them\n            in a single model, with or without indicator variables.\nRecognition of the relevance of sufficient causes to QOL assessment is hardly new:\n            Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC) noted that (\n49\n)\n`When it comes to saying in what happiness consists, opinions differ\u2026 and often the\n                  same person actually changes their opinion. When falling ill, it is said to be health;\n                  when hard up, it is said to be money.'\nGiven this, it is all the more surprising that researchers in QOL have not taken an\n            explicit account of sufficient causes in QOL work.\n5.\u2003Psychometric and clinimetric approaches\n5.1.\u2003Traditional psychometrics\nThe traditional psychometric approach characterizes the underlying concept as a latent\n               variable, with known relationships to multiple observed or manifest variables. The\n               items in a scale are usually intended to be independent\nparallel tests\n, such that the items are estimates of the same true score (corresponding to the latent\n               variable) and have uncorrelated error terms with zero means and equal variances. Most\n               psychometric methods remain applicable to a more generalized form of test, called\n               \u03c4\u2010\nequivalent tests\n, in which the constraint of equal variance error terms is relaxed. For parallel or\n\u03c4\n\u2010equivalent tests the items only appear to be correlated because of their relationship\n               with the latent variable, i.e. they are conditionally independent for any given value\n               of the latent variable.\nIn the traditional approach a model is built by the use of scaling methods, or factor\n               analysis and its generalizations, and parameters are estimated which permit the individual\n               patients' scores on the latent factor to be determined. A combination of multiple\n               observed variables is used because this is more reliable and less prone to random\n               error than single\u2010item measures are, as well as yielding superior discriminatory power.\n               The linear nature of the models means that the estimated value of the latent variable\n               is given as a weighted sum of the observed variables. Details of the basic models\n               may be found in\n3\n) and\n4\n).\nClearly such models may be appropriate for situations just involving indicator variables\u2014e.g.\n               for depression (\n16\n). By assumption, any covariances between the indicator variables are solely attributable\n               to their relationship with the common underlying factor. However, causal variables\n               behave differently. Covariances between causal variables may exist irrespective of\n               their relationship with the latent variable, this time induced by the common cause\n               of these variables. If, for example, several symptoms of a disease (indicators for\n               the disease, but causal for QOL) are included among the items, then they are likely\n               to be correlated through their relationship to the severity of disease, even after\n               we condition for the value of QOL. Thus causal variables do not constitute parallel\n               or\n\u03c4\n\u2010equivalent tests. Including these symptoms in a global factor analysis with the indicator\n               variables would be inappropriate for two reasons. First, the fact that they are causal,\n               not indicators, for QOL, would mean that they need not have the proper relationship\n               to the underlying factor tapped by the indicator variables. And, secondly, their mutual\n               correlation suggests another factor, distinct from that leading to the scores on the\n               indicator variables.\nIn summary, the basic traditional psychometric approach is only really suited to situations\n               involving indicator variables, and indicator variables alone.\nAn extension of the basic factor analysis model called a\nMIMIC model\n(standing for multiple indicator, multiple cause; see, for example,\n15\n)) is, at least at first sight, more appropriate. Whereas, in the factor analysis\n               model, all the manifest variables are influenced by the latent factor, in a MIMIC\n               model multiple causes together influence the factor, which itself then influences\n               the indicators. In view of our discussion about causal and indicator variables earlier,\n               this model is certainly nearer the mark. However, even such models are not ideal.\n               In particular, since MIMIC models are linear structural relational models, they do\n               not handle component causes properly\u2014the central QOL factor is taken as a weighted\n               sum of the causes, rather than something like the maximum of them, which we have argued\n               is more appropriate.\n5.1.1.\u2003Examples\nIn examples 1\u20133 factor analysis was used. In all three examples, items that are most\n                  plausibly causal (notably, symptoms) were either automatically dropped from the factor\n                  model irrespective of their clinical importance or, as in example 3, resulted in apparently\n                  strange factors that varied from study to study.\n5.2.\u2003Item response theory\nIRT is a more recent development. The early forms were based on responses to binary\n               items. The model provides probabilities for the responses of the patients or subjects\n               in terms of the\ndifficulty\nof the items and the\nability\n(for example) of the subjects. In an educational setting, students' ability represents\n               the latent variable, and the items, which are examination questions or tests, are\n               chosen to be of varying difficulty.\nRecent extensions have generalized this basic form (see, for example,\n29\n)). Item response models have not often been applied in clinical contexts, but there\n               has recently been increasing interest, as illustrated by the examples of its use with\n               QOL instruments given by\n28\n),\n10\n),\n58\n),\n39\n) and\n50\n). As with factor analytic models, in the basic IRT model, correlation between items\n               arises solely because the items are tapping a single underlying continuum.\nAs before, IRT models are inappropriate to handle situations involving causal variables.\n               Once again, independence of causal variables conditional on given values of the underlying\n               QOL will not hold in general. Causal variables may be correlated by virtue of having\n               been caused by disease or treatment. This conflicts with the assumption of local independence\n               that is made to estimate the parameters in IRT models. Moreover, the frequency of\n               occurrence of a symptom does not relate to its importance in leading to low QOL: pain,\n               for example, might occur with the same frequency in the sample as some other minor\n               symptom, and yet the impact on QOL might be much greater.\n5.3.\u2003Clinimetrics\nThe objective of the psychometric approaches outlined above might be characterized\n               as attempting to measure a single attribute by using multiple items. In contrast,\n               clinimetric methods attempt to summarize multiple attributes with a single index.\n               Now, of course, this cannot be done\u2014a single index loses the intrinsic differences\n               between the attributes and it also sacrifices any possibility of allowing for an interaction\n               (in the presence of attribute A, attribute B leads to poor QOL, but in the presence\n               of C it does not). Instead the researchers aim their strategies at choosing and suitably\n               emphasizing the most important attributes to be included in the index (\n63\n). In fact, of course, we are choosing how to\ndefine\nthe concept being measured by our choice of variables and the way of combining them.\n               This is why we have used the verb `to construct' in the context of clinimetric scales,\n               but not in the context of psychometric scales. Clinimetric scales are different from\n               psychometric scales because, in the former, the items to be included are chosen according\n               to what we want the scale to do, whereas in the latter they are chosen because they\n               are thought to be related to an underlying concept which defies explicit measurement.\n               (The issue of component causes is a further complication.) The psychometric approaches\n               are based on models of the relationships between the underlying latent variables and\n               the measured variables. This model permits us to infer backwards from the measured\n               variables, to deduce the likely value of the unobserved latent variable (through factor\n               analysis or IRT). In the psychometric case, sophisticated statistical methods are\n               used to ensure that the items are homogeneous in measuring a single construct, and\n               that the underlying continuum is unidimensional. It will be clear from the above characterizations\n               that the very question of homogeneity is contrary to what the clinimetric approach\n               is trying to achieve.\nThe clinimetric approaches are based on a deliberate choice of what variables to include\n               and, in the absence of an underlying model, a deliberate choice for how those variables\n               should be combined. In the case of component causes, outlined in Section 4, this is\n               that any large component cause is sufficient to imply poor QOL. No data analysis is\n               needed, nor is appropriate, to decide how to combine the individual constituents of\n               the clinimetric model (but see Section 9). Any relative importance to be attributed\n               to the individual components must come from outside the data\u2014from the objectives of\n               those constructing the scale. This should not be regarded as a shortcoming: it forces\n               the constructors of a scale to decide exactly what it is they want their index to\n               measure, and to make this public.\nIn summary, practical distinctions between psychometric and clinimetric scales are\n               that the former will\u2014or should\u2014only contain indicator variables whereas the latter\n               will typically include one or more causal variables. Also, psychometric scales should\n               be unidimensional, in the sense that all items reflect a single latent variable, whereas\n               clinimetric scales may consist of a composite index that combines items representing\n               several distinct latent variables.\n6.\u2003Validating scales\nThe validation of a scale is crucial. Without examination and evidence of the effectiveness\n            of a scale for its purpose, the scale is useless. Worse, it may even be misleading.\n            In this section we examine a few aspects of validating scales. A more comprehensive\n            description of scale development and validation is given in\n21\n).\nMany methods of validation rely heavily on the analysis of inter\u2010item or interscale\n            correlations. This possibility, which obviously only exists when scales comprise multiple\n            items, is invaluable: `with a single measure of each variable one can remain blissfully\n            unaware of the possibility of measurement error' (\n40\n). However, caution must be exercised when using such approaches with scales containing\n            causal variables.\nEssentially, such methods seek to explain the correlation between different items\n            in terms of a postulated underlying factor. However, we have already noted that causal\n            items are frequently correlated by virtue of being themselves caused by another factor,\n            external to the target concept. For example, when measuring QOL in cancer patients,\n            chemotherapy may induce one cluster of correlated symptoms, whereas radiotherapy might\n            result in a rather different correlation pattern; oesophageal cancer patients may\n            have one set of eating\u2010related problems, whereas laryngeal or gastric cancer patients\n            may have different patterns. Thus the correlations between causal variables will frequently\n            be due to extraneous factors, not QOL, and will vary from study to study.\nFurthermore, when these items form component causes, they may have very low correlations\n            yet still be deemed to belong to the same scale. Thus, sometimes a low correlation\n            between two causal items may even provide evidence for the need to retain both\u2014each\n            may be an important independent sufficient cause for the concept with which we are\n            concerned.\nHence those methods of validating scales that depend on an analysis of inter\u2010item\n            correlations will generally be highly suspect when causal items are present and may\n            lead to misleading or meaningless results.\nIn the following subsections we look at various aspects of the evaluation of scales\n            and explore the effect of the presence of causal variables.\n6.1.\u2003Content validity\nContent validity is concerned with the extent to which the items comprising a scale\n               cover all aspects of the latent variable and no additional features. In educational\n               tests, for example, it would be unreasonable to include items that are not related\n               to the syllabus on which the students are being examined, and to do so would result\n               in a test which is not assessing what it purports to assess. At the same time, the\n               test should cover a wide range of relevant aspects from the syllabus, since otherwise\n               there could be undetected differences in knowledge or ability between the students.\n               This is more important for causal variables than for indicator variables. For example,\n               if QOL is being evaluated through the presence of symptoms, it is essential to ensure\n               that all the disease\u2010specific symptoms that might affect QOL are covered. If a serious\n               but unexpected or unanticipated side\u2010effect occurs, the QOL may be greatly affected.\n               In contrast, by virtue of the fact that indicator variables are tapping the same underlying\n               concept, the omission of one is not so crucial.\n6.1.1.\u2003Example\nIn examples 1 and 2, psychometric analyses would have resulted in the omission of\n                  items that were rated as clinically important or rated by patients as being of high\n                  impact. In these examples the authors recognized the need to retain all these items\n                  and realized that clinimetric methods resulted in superior scales.\n6.2.\u2003Construct validity\nConstruct validity embraces a variety of techniques for assessing the degree to which\n               an instrument measures the concept that it was designed to measure. In practical terms,\n               it is concerned with testing dimensionality (is the assumption that there is a single\n               latent variable supported by the evidence?), testing homogeneity (do all the items\n               appear to be tapping into the same latent variable?) and, if there is more than one\n               latent variable, testing the extent to which they overlap (do some items from one\n               subscale correlate with other latent variables?).\nConstruct validation is best seen as a process of learning more about the joint behaviour\n               of the items, and of making and testing new predictions about this behaviour. Factor\n               analysis is, of course, a key technique in this process. Unfortunately, since factor\n               analysis is based on the covariance structure between the items, it is as we have\n               seen of limited relevance when causal variables are present. A global factor analysis\n               of the items may give very misleading information about the latent variable of interest\n               if causal variables are present; at best, it may reflect such constructs as clusters\n               of disease\u2010related symptoms (syndromes) or therapeutic side\u2010effects, rather than constructs\n               reflecting dimensions of QOL. However, factor analysis of subgroups of items might\n               lead to useful ways of condensing those causal variables for QOL that are indicators\n               of some common external influence, such as treatment. We return to this possibility\n               in Section 9.\n6.2.1.\u2003Example\nIn example 3, factor analysis resulted in a `symptom factor' that contained items\n                  which were unexpected in terms of their relationship with QOL. These items were merely\n                  the common side\u2010effects of the particular form of therapy that was used in the Medical\n                  Research Council trial and were correlated through their relationship with treatment,\n                  not QOL. This also explains why other investigators had reported apparently unstable\n                  factors, differing from study to study according to the disease subgroup and the therapy\n                  being applied.\n6.3.\u2003Reliability\nThe reliability of a scale (\n14\n) is the extent to which the scale yields reproducible and consistent results. Confusingly,\n               this word is used for two distinct aspects of validating scales. Firstly, under traditional\n               psychometric theory, multi\u2010item scales should be homogeneous with high\ninternal reliability\nor\ninternal consistency\n. Secondly, measurements and scores should be\nrepeatable\n, in that, if the test is applied on two occasions to a patient whose condition is\n               stable, the results should be similar. We discuss repeatability\u2013reliability in the\n               next subsection.\nThe most common method for assessing internal consistency is Cronbach's \u03b1 (\n12\n), which is a form of intraclass correlation. It is closely related to convergent\n               validity, i.e. the extent to which the items in a scale are all highly intercorrelated.\n               If the items are uncorrelated \u03b1=0, whereas if the items are identical \u03b1=1. This is\n               appropriate for measures involving indicator variables, since any subset of those\n               variables will be tapping the same underlying concept\u2014if the model is correct. However,\n               Cronbach's \u03b1 is generally unsuitable for situations involving causal variables, firstly\n               because dropping such a variable from the measure clearly substantially distorts it\n               and secondly because as we have seen the inter\u2010item correlation structure will depend\n               on extraneous factors. In some special cases, however, something along these lines\n               might be possible. For example, if each causal variable is, itself, a latent variable\n               derived from several manifest variables, then dropping components of each causal submodel\n               might be appropriate.\n6.3.1.\u2003Examples\nIn example 4, the authors noted that Cronbach's \u03b1 was low for some scales and attributed\n                  this to the heterogeneous nature of the clinical summary index. The items concerned\n                  were invariably those that were obviously causal.\n38\n), in example 2, also found that whereas their psychometric strategy resulted in scales\n                  with high \u03b1, as expected, this was not the case when they used the clinimetric approach.\n6.4.\u2003General issues of validation\nIn the preceding subsections we pointed out the difficulties of assessing reliability\n               and validity when causal variables were involved. The fact that it is difficult does\n               not detract from its importance.\nSometimes some indications of validity can be gained from adaptations of methods aimed\n               at tapping a hypothetical gold standard. For example,\nknown groups\nvalidity is based on the hypothesis that certain specified groups of patients are\n               expected to score better (or worse) than others. Thus patients with advanced cancer\n               might be expected to have a poorer QOL than those with early disease. If the scale\n               is valid it should show differences between these groups, and the differences should\n               be in the expected direction. If a scale cannot successfully distinguish between groups\n               for whom there are known differences, either because it lacks sensitivity or because\n               it yields results that are contrary to expectations, the scale is hardly likely to\n               be of value for many other purposes.\nA similar argument applies if more than one scale, purportedly assessing the same\n               or similar concepts, is available. However, if clinimetric scales are not identical,\n               they are defining different summary indices and should not be expected to yield identical\n               scores. In general, even for psychometric scales, we would rarely expect two instruments\n               to give identical scores, and when they do not there remains the question which is\n               the better? Problems of interpretation become simpler if one scale is regarded as\n               the gold standard, as for example when the objective is to produce a shortened form\n               that is almost as effective as the original.\nThe usefulness of a measure depends on its ability to detect clinically significant\n               differences. This is often described in terms of\nsensitivity\n(the ability to detect differences between groups) and\nresponsiveness\n(the ability to detect changes over time within a patient). Sensitivity can be investigated\n               in a study comparing groups of patients, and responsiveness can be explored by longitudinal\n               studies. Different scales can then be compared by using such criteria as the\nstandardized response mean\n(the ratio of the mean change to the standard deviation of that change, or the\neffect size\n(the ratio of the mean change to the standard deviation of the initial measurement),\n               as in\n21\n). Again, these are not affected by the inclusion of causal variables in the model.\nTest\u2013retest\nstudies of patients who are stable should yield consistent results\u2014the level of agreement\n               between the two occasions is a measure of the\nreliability\nor\nrepeatability\nof the instrument. If the period of stability is sufficiently long that memory effects\n               can be ignored, then this is an approach that can be adopted even with scales which\n               include causal items. For example, patients with stable disease and not receiving\n               treatment might perhaps be expected to have a stable QOL over periods of a few weeks.\n               Of course, the determination of stability then must be made by using some external\n               criterion.\nInterrater reliability\nis another aspect of repeatability. Do we expect independent observers to obtain\n               comparable results and, if so, how large is the difference? Traditional test theory\n               defines reliability as the ratio of the variance of the true scores to that of the\n               observed scores and uses measures such as intraclass correlations or Cohen's\n\u03ba\nto standardize the results relative to the amount of agreement that we would expect\n               to achieve by chance. More recent developments in\ngeneralizability theory\nuse analysis of variance to decompose errors into different sources (\n14\n). However, in QOL assessment, the rationale for `asking the patient' is that only\n               the patient can give a meaningful assessment of their own QOL, and so the use of other\n               raters is dubious.\n6.5.\u2003Item selection\nIn all questionnaires the selection and wording of items is of crucial importance,\n               and each item should be carefully evaluated before it is included (\n21\n). In particular, new questionnaires should be tested by using pilot studies. For\n               scales consisting solely of indicator items, standard psychometric methods can be\n               applied. In particular, any items that are poorly correlated with the others in the\n               same scale might be removed, since this suggests that they are tapping into other\n               factors. Equally, very high correlations may indicate that some items are redundant.\nFor causal items, however, the situation is somewhat different. They will have been\n               chosen on the basis that they constitute an important aspect of the concept\u2014are intrinsic\n               to the definition of that concept. Therefore they cannot be dropped, without careful\n               thought for what this implies about the nature of the latent variable under investigation.\n               Breadth of coverage is particularly important here, and it is crucial to ensure that\n               all relevant causal areas are included (\n18\n). For QOL, usually this will be based on interviews with patients.\nIn practice, the optimal approach would seem to be to combine the two methods, relying\n               on psychometric techniques for the presumedly homogeneous scales that comprise items\n               which are likely to be indicator variables; factor analysis enables the exploration\n               of dimensionality, and internal reliability and consistency can be assessed by using\n               standard techniques. In contrast, the items that are ostensibly causal, including\n               in particular symptoms and side\u2010effects, are best handled by such clinimetric techniques\n               as asking the patients to rate their impact.\n6.5.1.\u2003Examples\nGiven the above, it is not surprising to note that clinimetric and psychometric strategies\n                  result in scales which include different sets of items, as seen in our examples 1\n                  and 2. In example 1, fewer than half the items were common to both approaches.\n18\n) observed that the notion of causal variables sufficed to explain all the differences\n                  that\n34\n) had noted in example 1: the items deemed important but excluded by the psychometric\n                  approach were without exception causal items (problems associated with cigarette smoke,\n                  having to avoid dust, weather or air pollution, etc.). However, those that\nwould have been included\nif psychometric methods had been used but\nexcluded\nusing clinimetrics were indicator variables that reflected QOL but were regarded\n                  by patients as of less importance. Similarly, in example 2, which sought to construct\n                  a disabilities scale, the clinimetric approach ranked 12 symptom items and three psychological\n                  disability items in the top 30, whereas the psychometric approach selected almost\n                  exclusively physical disability items\u2014 these serving as indicator variables for the\n                  disabilities scale.\n7.\u2003Scoring\nAs we have noted earlier, indicator scales are most frequently scored using simple\n            summation\u2014the items are scored using integers corresponding to severity, and these\n            scores are summed. This, of course, is based on the notion that there is an underlying\n            factor contributing to each measured item. Since different subscales may contain different\n            numbers of items, it is common either to use an average instead of the total score\n            or, more frequently, a score that has been standardized to lie between 0 and 100 (\n62\n;\n17\n;\n27\n). If the items form truly parallel tests with indicator variables, this is an eminently\n            sensible procedure since each item is assumed to be an unbiased estimate of the same\n            latent effect. In principle it ought to be possible to improve on this by giving different\n            weights to each item, since it is very likely that some items are more important than\n            others. However, various researchers have noted that in practice weighting makes little\n            impact (\n61\n;\n13\n;\n11\n;\n48\n). Equal weights may not be optimal, but they are usually adequate and it is obviously\n            so much simpler to use equal weights. There are also implicit assumptions that all\n            items are scored with the same number of categories, and that the categories correspond\n            to an equal interval scale. For example, for the EORTC QLQ\u2010C30 instrument (\n1\n;\n17\n) it is assumed that the effect of moving from a score of `1\u2003\u2261\u2003not at all' to `2\u2003\u2261\u2003a\n            little' is of equal magnitude to changing from `3\u2003\u2261\u2003quite a bit' to `4\u2003\u2261\u2003very much'.\nScales based on IRT will include items of varying difficulty and again a simple approximation\n            might be to use a summation of scores on the grounds that the more able subjects are\n            expected to obtain a higher proportion of `correct' answers. `Activities of daily\n            living' scales are often used as a measure of physical functioning. These scales consist\n            of a series of items of varying difficulty, such as being able to dress without help\n            through to being able to carry heavy loads, to climb stairs or to take long walks.\n            The items in such scales are often summed. However, IRT models allow an estimation\n            of difficulties of items and hence more accurate methods of scoring\u2014but it is still\n            not clear whether the extra complexity of IRT scoring makes very much difference in\n            the results (\n39\n) although some researchers suggest that it can result in more sensitive scales (\n50\n).\nWhen causal variables are involved, especially component causes, both simple summation\n            and weighted sums are less easy to justify. There is no common latent factor being\n            tapped by each of the causal variables. They may be acting in an entirely independent\n            way, so that any one, by itself, should lead to a poor QOL, if sufficiently severe.\n            We noted earlier that under these circumstances an appropriate model might be to take\n            the maximum of the causal variables. A variant on this idea has been suggested by\n7\n). For variables\nx\nj\ntaking values between 0 and 1, with high values meaning that the cause is present,\n            the value of\ny\ndefined by\nis large if any one\nx\nj\n\u2010variable is high. This model is also equivalent to the multiplicative utility formula\n            proposed by\n59\n) for combining patients' preference values relating to items into an overall utility\n            score. The classical linear models (based on factor analysis, for example), leading\n            to simple weighted sums, are only appropriate for the indicator variables.\nThus indicator variables may often be combined by using unweighted sums; alternatively,\n            if preferred, data analytic methods may be utilized. For causal variables, in contrast,\n            the choice of weights\n\u03b2\nj\nis of crucial importance and these are either part of the definition of the latent\n            variable or are a matter of opinion, based on for example patients' preferences or\n            utilities.\n8.\u2003Choice of weights for causal variables\nA small value of\n\u03b2\nj\nmeans that the\nj\nth factor is regarded as relatively unimportant, but there remains the question of\n            how to choose the\n\u03b2\nj\nin such a model. Since these represent the clinimetric aspect of the model, they\n            should be chosen on the basis of how we want to weight the relative components of\n            the model\u2014how we want to define the measuring instrument. The choice of the\n\u03b2\nj\n\u2010values is thus not a data analytic problem, but one of definition.\nFor QOL scales, since causal variables have an effect on patients' QOL, it would seem\n            necessary to base any scoring method on some measure of impact derived by asking the\n            patient, with item weights derived from patients' opinions. We could base the weights\n            on a consensus derived from community estimates or average ratings of the relative\n            importance (not severity) of the various components from a sample of patients, on\n            the assumption that most patients will place approximately similar importance on the\n            various symptoms and side\u2010effects (\n41\n;\n35\n). This is a widely used approach for methods based on psychometric models, but in\n            fact patients may differ considerably on what they regard as important (\n60\n;\n46\n), and patients even define the components of QOL for others differently from the\n            way in which they perceive their own QOL (\n44\n). A few QOL instruments allow patients either to select the things that they regard\n            as having the greatest effect on their life or to place relative importance on the\n            items (\n60\n;\n46\n;\n32\n).\nOther approaches have been proposed, for example based on scenarios representing disease\n            states that are rated by patients. The multiattribute utility approach of\n59\n) is closest to our model and involves an empirical assessment of patients' utilities\n            for different combinations of item states. Other forms include judgment analysis,\n            used by\n9\n), and discrete choice conjoint analysis (\n55\n).\nNo form of preference analysis and weighting is without problems. One problem, of\n            course, is separating the relative importance from the current relative severity:\n            severe pain today may mean that pain is weighted more highly than it was yesterday.\n9.\u2003Combining causal and indicator variables\nFrequently there is little need or justification for combining causal and indicator\n            variables; often they naturally group themselves into distinct subscales that assess\n            particular aspects, or `dimensions', of QOL. The purpose of subscales, especially\n            those involving symptoms, is usually to assess one or more aspects of QOL in greater\n            detail, to learn about the impact of disease or therapy. In general, we recommend\n            that one attempts to create scales that avoid mixing causal and indicator variables.\nAlso, there is on\u2010going debate about whether QOL is a multidimensional construct\u2014for\n            example, many claim that it has distinct dimensions such as emotional, physical, social\n            and cognitive that are impossible to summarize by a single number. However, in contradiction,\n            most people accept that it is possible to reply to global questions such as `All things\n            considered, how would you rate your overall quality of life?' or even, in principle\n            (although it might be considered unethical to ask patients), `Do you feel life is\n            worth living?' and that therefore there can be a single latent variable. As we note\n            in the discussion, many researchers advocate that, if one does require a global assessment\n            of QOL, why not simply ask the patient?\nHowever, we may at times seek to combine the two types of variable into a composite\n            summary scale. Also, we may wish to use a modelling approach to explore the interrelationships\n            and contributions of various items. This leads us to consider models that allow the\n            combination of indicator and causal variables. The following is one such model, provided\n            that we assume that we can characterize each variable as either solely causal or solely\n            indicator. In our model we have taken QOL to be a measurable latent variable.\nFirst, groups of indicator variables are each reduced to a score on their common single\n            factor by a factor analysis. We shall require that the components of our model take\n            values between 0 and 1, with 1 corresponding to poor values. If there are\nm\nfactors, we write\nz\ni\nfor the\ni\nth factor (\ni\n=1,\u2026,\nm\n). Then, if the factor resulting from the indicator variables\nx\ni\nis \u03a3\nj\n\u03b1\ni\nj\nx\ni\nj\n, taking (for illustration) arbitrary real values, a logistic transformation to\nwill yield a component for the overall model with the requisite properties.\nThe causal variables will frequently be single measured variables. However, sometimes\n            they might themselves each be the result of a factor analysis of a set of related\n            variables, as we suggested in Section 6; this could be applicable if, for example,\n            a group of causal variables formed a stable factor representing an aspect of the disease\n            or treatment, or if the causal variables were thought to reflect one homogeneous underlying\n            causal factor. We shall denote these causal variables or causal factors by\nz\nm\n+1\n,\u2026,\nz\np\n(after logistic transformations, if necessary, so that they take values between 0\n            and 1).\nThe various components in the model\u2014the factors derived from the groups of indicator\n            variables, and the measured or derived causal variables\u2014are then combined using a\n            Blalock\u2010type model:\nIn full, letting\nx\nij\ndenote the\nj\nth component variable of the\ni\nth causal variable or the\nj\nth indicator variable from the\ni\nth group of indicator variables, where\ni\n=1,\u2026,\np\n,\nThe values of\n\u03b2\ni\nare obtained as described in the previous section.\nAgain we note that we are not proposing this as a complete solution, but merely a\n            suggestion for one way forward. It does depend on the ability to decide which variables\n            are causal and which are indicator\u2014discussed further in the next section. In some\n            situations other than the assessment of QOL this categorization is more straightforward.\n            In particular, in situations where there is a chronological order, with the causal\n            variables necessarily preceding the indicator variables, then the categorization is\n            clear. Thus, for example, we might define a `propensity to respond well to medication'\n            variable in terms of initial characteristics of the individual (age, sex, previous\n            illnesses, and so on) as well as records of how well the patient has responded to\n            other medications in the past. Here the ini\u2010 tial characteristics will correspond\n            to our causal variables, and the previous responses to indicator variables.\n10.\u2003Identification of causal and indicator variables\nAlthough we have labelled variables as either causal or indicator, in fields such\n            as QOL research many items will be of intermediate type. For example, we have described\n            pain as causal and depression as indicator. In practice, depression\ncauses\npatients to become more sensitive to pain, such that for a given pain stimulus they\n            will report greater levels of pain. And pain causes more depression. Thus pain is\n            often described as having two components (e.g.\n42\n)): the original sensation (due to intensity, location, etc.) and a reactive component\n            (due to personality, emotional state, etc.). Clinicians know that they can treat either\n            one of pain or depression, and both will be alleviated.\nVariables may even also shift around. For example, cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer\n            commonly induces nausea and vomiting. Some cancer patients who have experienced these\n            problems after their initial course of treatment may start vomiting before the administration\n            of a subsequent course of treatment. Here an initially apparently causal variable\n            (for QOL) has acquired an indicator aspect\u2014although it is arguably still causal as\n            anticipatory vomiting may reduce QOL yet further. Thus there may frequently be uncertainty\n            and ambiguity about the precise role of variables in QOL assessment. Disease or treatment\u2010related\n            symptom clusters are likely to be predominantly causal, but it may be less clear whether\n            psychological and other items are mainly causal or indicator in nature. However, any\n            QOL variable that is largely causal will be subject to treatment\u2010 or disease\u2010related\n            correlations, and so psychometric techniques will not be applicable. Psychometric\n            techniques apply only to indicator variables, for which the correlations arise solely\n            by virtue of their relationship to the latent variable, QOL.\nHow can we identify causal variables? We do not have an estimate of the true value\n            for the latent variable\u2014for that is the purpose of constructing our scale to start\n            with\u2014and we have postulated that the usual psychometric estimation procedures are\n            unreliable.\n20\n) overcame this problem by arguing that the seven\u2010point global question `How would\n            you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?' provided a valid surrogate\n            assessment of the latent variable QOL and compared individual items against this.\n            A graphical method was used to examine whether high levels of individual item responses\n            `caused' poor QOL, and whether conversely poor QOL was associated with high levels\n            of the same items. Evidence of an asymmetrical relationship was taken as suggestive\n            of component causes.\nAnother consequence of causal relationships that we can exploit is that inter\u2010item\n            correlations do not reflect the relationships with the latent variable. Thus in many\n            situations causal variables will give rise to seemingly inexplicable factors structures.\n10.1.\u2003Example\nIn example 3,\n19\n) showed that factor analysis of QOL data yielded an apparently strange combination\n               of items as a single factor\u2014strange in that the items did not make clinical sense\n               as interrelated symptoms. They were merely common effects of the therapy being used\n               on this particular group of patients. Other forms of therapy, with different side\u2010effects,\n               would have produced different combinations of these causal items. But it is difficult\n               to use `strangeness' as a measure of whether variables are causal.\n10.2.\u2003Tests for causal variables\nFor a more formal test, we can make use of the fact that causal variables are not\n               parallel items and therefore lack conditional independence. Thus for QOL we might\n               expect that the treatment or severity of disease would remain important determinants\n               of the level of response for causal variables, and that this would result in correlations\n               between the items, even after conditioning for the overall level of QOL (or a subscale\n               of QOL, if a multidimensional model for QOL is used). This points towards the use\n               of conditional logistic regression, or of psychometric methods for detecting differential\n               item functioning (DIF). The concept of DIF is that the supposedly parallel items in\n               a scale should, for any given value of the latent variable, be independent of each\n               other and should be equally good indicators of the underlying factor. In education,\n               for example, no single test item ought either to favour or discriminate against pupils\n               of a particular gender or race; if it does, it is said to suffer from DIF and is a\n               biased test item. Causal variables will exhibit DIF with respect to an extraneous\n               factor, namely the one that they reflect\u2014treatment or severity of disease in our case\u2014and\n               will not serve purely as parallel indicators of the target latent variable, QOL. A\n               whole battery of tests has been developed for assessing DIF (\n33\n), and our initial findings are that these tests provide a very effective and sensitive\n               method for detecting variables that are wholly or partially causal in nature.\nTests for DIF can indicate variables that are not performing well as purely indicator\n               variables, but no such data\u2010based test can conclusively prove that a variable is causal.\n8\n) acknowledged that distinguishing these variables `can be troublesome'. Sometimes\n               temporal changes may be informative; if a change in pain levels is observed to precede\n               changes in QOL, it might imply that pain is causative. The difficulty in detecting\n               such temporal effects is obvious. Therefore, the most convincing approach would seem\n               to be a `thought test'. Imagine a large increase in pain. Is it likely that QOL would\n               be affected? Now imagine a patient starting with a good QOL. If their QOL deteriorates\n               markedly, do we expect them necessarily to be suffering physical pain? Do we expect\n               their pain score to reflect the change in their QOL? The answer is surely no; they\n               might have other reasons for their poor QOL. Therefore, pain is best thought of as\n               a causal variable. Furthermore, for many items the whole reason for including them\n               in a QOL scale is precisely because the clinician or patient intuitively realizes\n               that they are consequences of the treatment and are essentially causing an impact\n               on QOL.\nFor QOL scales, the seemingly na\u00efve thought test will frequently suffice to distinguish\n               indicator variables from those that are predominantly causal. Since the fundamental\n               assumptions for psychometric methods are violated by causal variables, we suggest\n               that one should err on the side of caution and treat as causal those variables whose\n               causal or indicator nature remains uncertain after the thought test.\n11.\u2003Discussion\nQOL is affected by causal variables and the level of QOL manifests itself in indicator\n            variables. However, standard approaches to QOL measurement have been predominantly\n            based on psychometric approaches, which implicitly assume only the latter kind of\n            variables. This leads to either (Likert) summated scales or, more recently, scales\n            based and scored on IRT principles. The principal focus of methods of construction\n            and assessment has been the correlation structure of the data\u2014which is inappropriate\n            for causal variables.\n24\n) has commented\n`Quality of life, despite some promising recent efforts, currently lacks suitable\n                  strategies for its assessment. The absence of instruments suitable for measuring quality\n                  of life can be explained, in part, by two distinct but related phenomena: a slavish\n                  devotion to psychometric, as opposed to clinimetric, techniques and a failure to recognise\n                  the fundamental importance of patients' individual values and preferences.'\nWe suggest that an appreciation of the two types of variable, indicator and causal,\n            will enable developers of scales to identify appropriate methods for the selection\n            of items, the construction of scales and the validation of scales. The two principal\n            approaches, psychometric (whether traditional or IRT) and clinimetric, both have important\n            roles, but the choice of method should depend on the items comprising the scale. An\n            uncritical application of either one method on its own is likely to result in two\n            very different scales, and in both cases the result may be inadequate. Also, it is\n            disturbing to note that anyone developing a scale by using traditional methods would\n            remain blissfully unaware that they may be omitting important items or including inappropriate\n            items. Practical details of how to apply both psychometric methods and the clinimetric\n            approach to the development and validation of a scale are contained in\n21\n).\nGeneric instruments (non disease specific) for assessing QOL may be less affected\n            by causal variables than those that are intended to be disease specific. The latter\n            by definition tend to focus specifically on the symptoms that are associated with\n            a particular disease, and on the commoner side\u2010effects of therapies. Thus disease\u2010specific\n            QOL instruments can be expected to contain a high proportion of causal items. For\n            these instruments, or at least for their causal items and subscales, a clinimetric\n            approach should be used. Psychometric methods, although much used in the past, are\n            not appropriate and lead to instruments that are either suboptimal or invalid.\nThe distinction between indicator and causal variables seems sometimes almost to have\n            been recognized in the QOL literature: sometimes subsets of variables are combined\n            to yield a subscale, and clinicians intuitively prefer to keep these subscales distinct.\n            The EORTC QLQ\u2010C30 instrument is designed to measure aspects of QOL, and thus contains\n            five multi\u2010item functioning scales and three multi\u2010item symptom scales, and the scoring\n            instructions for the QLQ\u2010C30 instrument recommend that these items should\nnot\nbe combined to give a score for overall QOL (\n17\n). Psychometric methods can be applied within subsets of indicator variables, as we\n            have suggested above, but the subsets should not be combined with causal variables\n            by using the same method.\nThis is all very well, but there is clearly a need to supplement the reporting of\n            individual items and subscales with a summary measure that may be regarded as representative\n            of overall QOL. A simple linear sum of causal variables may be useful in some limited\n            situations\u2014for example, a total of all serious symptoms might be regarded as a measure\n            of `symptom burden'. However, it cannot be regarded as a measure of overall QOL. An\n            obvious approach is, of course, simply to ask the patient. Many instruments do contain\n            a global question such as `How would you rate your overall quality of life during\n            the past week?' (\n17\n), and it has been advocated that all QOL instruments should (\n25\n). Global questions allow patients to perform their own weighting and integration\n            of aspects of QOL. The question might be asked in the context of a structured interview,\n            which reminded the patients of the items to be taken into consideration when giving\n            their answer. A third alternative is to devise a scale based entirely on items that\n            are indicators of QOL and are not causal.\nFinally, we have speculated about a fourth alternative, which permits the possibility\n            of combining causal with indicator items in a proper manner. It goes without saying\n            that this proposal has weaknesses. There are just too many aspects to it. In particular,\n            things are complicated by the fact that it will not always be easy to characterize\n            variables as either uniquely indicator or uniquely causal; as we have shown, it is\n            possible that some may be partly indicator and partly causal. Despite such shortcomings,\n            we believe that our proposal explicitly recognizes and permits the combination of\n            the two qualitatively distinct kinds of measure in a way that appears not to have\n            been suggested before. We also hope that it will stimulate further discussion and\n            in doing so lead to a further development of the field.\nDiscussion on the paper by Fayers and Hand\nD. J. Bartholomew\n(\nStoke Ash\n)\nStatistics depends crucially on measurement yet statisticians have not been prominent\n            among those actually constructing measures. This has largely been left to practitioners\n            in, for example, psychology, economics and medicine. This paper is therefore particularly\n            welcome because it brings a very important practical measurement problem into the\n            statistical arena. As the authors make clear, this is an extremely complex and subtle\n            problem and I shall have to simplify things greatly to make my point. Essentially,\n            I wish to argue that, although the distinction between indicator and causal variables\n            is fundamental, the former are more directly relevant to constructing scales of measurement.\nAn idealized version of the problem of measuring quality of life (QOL) is shown in\nFig.\u20031\nwhere\nz\nrepresents QOL; its assumed relationship to\ny\n(the indicators) and\nw\n(the causal variables) is indicated by the arrows. The region above the line represents\n            the real world of observable quantities. Here we find both the causal variables and\n            the indicators. The region below the line represents the world constructed by statisticians\n            and it contains unknown parameters, latent variables, normal distributions and so\n            forth. Statistical inference, in its most general terms, involves constructing the\n            lower region from what we observe in the upper region.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\n.\nAssumed relationship between causal variables, indicators and quality of life\nCaption\n.\u2002Assumed relationship between causal variables, indicators and quality of life\nIt is easy to see from\nFig.\u20031\nwhy factor analysis does not work when applied to a mixture of causal and indicator\n            variables. In the factor model all arrows go upwards from\nz\n. Thus any correlation among the causal variables will be treated as arising from\nz\nwhereas, in reality, it may not be related to the latent variable at all. We may\n            therefore easily obtain `strange' factors emerging as the authors have found. Furthermore,\n            the\ny\ns are also indicators of the\nw\ns acting indirectly through\nz\n. Even if there happens to be no correlation at all between the\nw\ns they will still appear in the factor scores for the first factor because of their\n            correlation with the\ny\ns. (The situation is not unlike that in regression, where we often find that the weights\n            carried by predictors in the regression equation do not match our judgment of their\n            real importance.)\nThat being so we come to the author's question: how should we combine causal and indicator\n            variables in a single measure? I shall adopt the perspective of the general approach\n            to social measurement that is set out in\n1\n) and\n2\n). This argues that we must start from a statistical model embracing all observed\n            and latent variables and then derive a measure by using the posterior distribution\n            of the latent variable given the indicators. This is a natural approach for a statistician\n            but closely parallels much of the traditional psychometric treatment that is mentioned\n            in the paper.\nSuch a model must specify the joint distribution of\ny\n,\nz\nand\nw\n. In the absence of\nw\nthis would be done using the conditional distribution of\ny\ngiven\nz\nand the prior distribution of\nz\n. The natural way to specify the effect of the causal variables on\nz\nwould be through the conditional distribution of\nz\ngiven\nw\n. However, although the posterior distribution of\nz\non\ny\nand\nw\ncan be found from these three distributions there appears to be a problem with the\n            scaling of\nz\n. This approach therefore poses problems for combining the indicators and causal variables\n            into a single measure. But this difficulty can be circumvented if, as I have suggested,\n            we regard the indicators as already taking account of the causal variables through\n            the mediating effect of the latent variable.\nThis proposal is not as abstruse as the formal approach may suggest; it is quite familiar\n            in other fields. Consider, for example, driving ability. Many causal variables contribute\n            to a person's driving ability\u2014age, eyesight, response times, physique, knowledge of\n            the\nHighway Code\netc.\u2014none of these are\ncaused\nby driving ability. Their effect on whether one passes a driving test is real but\n            no direct account is taken of them. All that counts is how the driver actually performs\n            when tested. Would those who want to include causal variables in measures of QOL also\n            wish to include them in the driving test? I deduce from what the authors say that\n            this conclusion will not be palatable to some working in the medical field. Nevertheless,\n            it is where the logic of the problem seems to lead.\nThe paper is full of interesting ideas and perceptive observations. I hope that the\n            authors will continue their collaboration which, I am sure, will lead to greater understanding\n            between statisticians and those at the sharp end of empirical research. I have much\n            pleasure in proposing a very warm vote of thanks.\nDavid R. Jones\n(\nUniversity of Leicester\n)\nPresident, speakers, Fellows, guests: I would like to begin with the quotation\n`There are difficulties inherent in almost all aspects of the definition, collection\n                  and analysis of data about quality of life in patients undergoing treatment \u2026 [but]\n                  \u2026 such data describe an important aspect of treatment and should not be ignored merely\n                  on the grounds of the practical and theoretical difficulties involved'.\nAlthough it is not witty, I think that it is wise, but I should immediately declare\n            an interest, since it is a product of a previous collaboration with Peter Fayers (\n6\n)! He has wisely found a new partner or two since then and begun to tackle some of\n            these difficulties.\nThis paper is valuable in providing us with a clear map of and lexicon for the nature\n            of variables and scales, with particular relevance to the assessment of health\u2010related\n            quality of life (HRQOL). Psychometric and clinimetric approaches are distinguished,\n            and the roles and implications of casual and indicator variables in the development\n            and testing of instruments set out. Professor Bartholomew has expressed doubts about\n            this information, but it will at least be widely agreed, I think, that a putative\n            causal structure needs to be kept in mind throughout the process of the development\n            and analysis of scales.\nRather less is in fact said by the authors about the implementation and use of the\n            instruments, or about implications for analysis. I would thus like to consider briefly\n            some implications for medical statisticians undertaking tasks other than the primary\n            development of scales, using the author's terminology. These include the following.\n(a)\nSelection of instruments for use in particular contexts:\nin this role we shall need to know how the scale was constructed originally, and\n            in particular to reach a reasonably clear understanding of which variables were originally\n            considered causal and which indicator variables, so that the relevance of the instrument\n            in the new context, wherein both component cause and latent variables may have changed\n            from the original, may be assessed. If this is to be achieved, the reporting of initial\n            scale and instrument development needs to be clearer and more explicit than it often\n            is in practice.\n(b)\nDevelopment and validation of modifications of instruments\n: the modification of existing instruments by the addition of items relevant to symptoms\n            or other aspects of HRQOL specific to the new disease context in which it is proposed\n            to use an existing instrument is common practice. The key need will be to identify\n            sufficient component causal variables for this new aspect of HRQOL. Thereafter, the\n            original scale will need to be understood, as above, so that, for example, causal\n            and indicator variables are not unwittingly combined. Issues of the analysis of the\n            modified scale, particularly of weighting, will also frequently arise.\n(c)\nAnalysis of HRQOL data\n: the choice of weights \u03b2\nj\nfor causal factors may indeed be crucial. In principle, the use of weights based\n            on individual patients' own preferences and utilities is very desirable, but it raises\n            problems not only of elicitation but also of analysis and interpretation of heterogeneous\n            composite measures, except possibly at an aggregated global HRQOL measure level. The\n            resurrection of Blalock's approach as a preferable alternative to (weighted or unweighted)\n            summation of items for a collection of causal variables is a valuable recommendation.\nHowever, an important pragmatic reservation needs to be expressed. It will be apparent\n            that, if the implications of the distinction between variables types are to be followed\n            through, the\nidentification\nof, say, causal variables is essential. I am somewhat disappointed, therefore, that\n            ultimately `the seemingly na\u00efve thought test' for distinguishing causal from indicator\n            variables is the main proposal for this identification step, at least in HRQOL applications.\n            If a test such as this has good properties, its simplicity is certainly no disadvantage,\n            but both examples cited in the paper and our wider experience suggest that simply\n            advocating that researchers ask themselves whether each variable is plausibly causal\n            or not is not reliable. The alternative strategy of comparisons against answers to\n            a global HRQOL question inevitably invites enquiry about the basis for validation\n            of that question or the gain from using a more complex instrument. If the authors'\n            formulation is to be effectively employed, more adequate operational implementations\n            of the suggested strategies are essential.\nSo, not all the difficulties of HRQOL measurement initially noted have of course yet\n            been resolved. None\u2010the\u2010less, this paper is a useful and stimulating contribution.\n            I am, therefore, pleased to congratulate the authors on their paper, and to second\n            the proposal of the vote of thanks.\nThe vote of thanks was passed by acclamation.\nD. R. Cox\n(\nNuffield College, Oxford\n)\nThe paper makes a valuable contribution to an important topic. It seems a pity, however,\n            to use the word\ncausal\nin the way done here; the word has such strong implications especially in a medical\n            and epidemiological setting.\nA key issue is that in, say, an educational context individual items have no intrinsic\n            interest. An answer to a question on algebra is valuable only to throw light on the\n            student's knowledge of algebra and to help to predict performance in related contexts.\n            Most of the items in health\u2010related quality\u2010of\u2010life studies are, though, of intrinsic\n            concern, especially for the management of individual patients. Even for, say, the\n            comparisons in a randomized trial, this raises the issue why introduce at all factor\n            analysis, the closely associated Rasch model, latent variables and so on? Indeed if\n            there were only two or three items in a particular dimension there would be no need\n            to do so. If, however, there are many items, the factor analysis representation is\n            a convenient way of expressing the ideas that we expect all the items in a dimension\n            to move systematically in the same direction and that there will be positive correlation\n            in the random variability. There is no necessity to think in terms of latent variables.\n            It is, however, as the authors explicitly discuss, important to supplement such overall\n            comparisons of treatment groups by checks that there are no items that are incompatible\n            with any systematic difference found. The important recent work of Svend Kreiner on\n            differential item response in the Rasch model, with its links to graphical Markov\n            models, deserves special mention.\nAt one level, however, all that is needed is this. If there is, say, a difference\n            in mean score favouring\nA\nover\nB\nin a particular dimension, look at the individual item mean differences to see whether\n            any appear to favour\nB\n. Under some admittedly relatively strong assumptions, limits of error can be placed\n            on that mean difference as some protection against choosing that item which, by chance,\n            happens to appear most anomalous.\nNiels Keiding\n(\nUniversity of Copenhagen\n)\nThe authors have described many difficulties connected to combining `causal' and `indicator'\n            variables into a single index. In the simplest situation there is one latent variable,\n            quality of life (QOL), influenced by the causal variables and itself governing the\n            distribution of the indicator variables. Professor Bartholomew, in proposing the vote\n            of thanks, outlined this situation and suggested that it is in general irrelevant\n            to include causal variables in an index capturing the latent variables: we need an\n            expression for QOL\nper se\nand possible relationships with causal variables are for later inquiry.\nBartholomew's position is in close agreement with standard practice in observational\n            epidemiology, where a considerable effort is being spent in characterizing variables\n            as\nresponses\n,\nexposures\n,\nconfounders\nor\nintermediate variables\n(and, yes, sometimes they are both of the last two possibilities, giving rise to\n            Robins's concept of\ntime\u2010dependent confounders\n). We also know from epidemiology that this distinction is in principle not a statistical\n            problem, but a postulate by which the subject\u2010matter researcher defines the point\n            from which the data are viewed\u2014and sometimes it is fruitful to conduct several analyses,\n            with different postulated causal directions. The essential point of the intermediate\n            variables is that we may never condition on these when assessing the effect of exposures,\n            because this effect will then be mistakenly diluted.\nThe general advice to scale constructors on the basis of this culture would seem to\n            be to consider carefully the causal structure\nfrom the subject\u2010matter insight that is available\nand to restrict attention to constructing scales based on variables causally post\n            QOL, called indicator variables by Fayers and Hand.\nWith this kind of general experience it is difficult to believe that it will ever\n            be desirable (not to mention feasible) to delineate\nempirically\nthe causal variables from the indicator variables, as Fayers and Hand seem to propose.\n            Not that their proposals are very convincing: certainly Rothman's some\u2010 what overexposed\n            component cause model is sometimes helpful, and then generalized additive models fit\n            poorly, but this is not a characterizing feature of causal variables, which often\n            do act additively on some scale.\nJ. L. Hutton\n(\nUniversity of Warwick, Coventry\n)\nI thank the authors for a thought\u2010provoking paper. Elucidation of different approaches\n            to quality of life is valuable. However, the variety of factors produced for the Rotterdam\n            symptom checklist highlights an issue that was not addressed by them. It is important\n            to know when in a study scales and items are selected for analysis and publication.\n            If a variety of quality\u2010of\u2010life measurements are assessed, and the `most significant'\n            are reported, any subsequent attempt at a systematic review and meta\u2010analysis will\n            be subject to severe bias (\n10\n;\n7\n).\nDavid Firth\n(\nNuffield College, Oxford\n)\nThe Blalock formula\n(\n3\n), page 105) for combining variables\nx\nj\nwhose values are between 0 and 1 has what might be termed a `nil cancellation' property:\n            a high score (close to 1) on, say,\nx\n1\nresults in a high value of\ny\n, regardless of the values of {\nx\n2\n,\nx\n3\n,\u2026}. In some contexts this will be undesirable. The extent to which a high score on\n            one variable can be mitigated by low scores on others will often need to be limited,\n            but not nullified.\nA generalization is\nwhich includes the Blalock formula at one extreme (\u03bb=\u221e) and yields the direct linear\n            combination\nin the limit as \u03bb\u21920. One interpretation is that, if the\nx\nj\nare each uniformly distributed on (0, 1), each\nx\nj\nis transformed so as to have the truncated\u2010at\u2010unity exponential(\u03bb) distribution before\n            linear combination using weights {\u03b2\nj\n}. This yields a continuum of possible cancellation properties, ranging from nil cancellation\n            (\u03bb=\u221e) to fully `linear' cancellation (\u03bb=0). A recent application was in the construction\n            of indices of local level deprivation in England (\n14\n) for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. There the need\n            for explicit weighting and a desire to limit cancellation\u2014which in that context meant\n            the cancellation of one kind of deprivation by lack of deprivations of other kinds\u2014led\n            to the use of a transformation as above with \u03bb=100/23, before weighted combination\n            of measures for six different `domains' of deprivation.\nThe following contributions were received in writing after the meeting.\nMichael Dewey\n(\nTrent Institute for Health Services Research, Nottingham\n)\nIn their thought\u2010provoking review Fayers and Hand wonder whether it might be possible\n            or ethical to ask patients `Do you feel life is worth living?'. This question has\n            been asked in community surveys of older people and since it predicts mortality (see\n18\n) for a review) clearly relates to quantity even if not quality of life. One might\n            wonder whether at times it is ethical not to ask it.\nGabrielle Kelly\n(\nUniversity College Dublin\n)\nI congratulate the authors on their comprehensive coverage of their topic. I found\n            their approach both innovative and useful.\nIt led me to reassess a paper that I recently co\u2010authored\u2014\n15\n). There we compared two groups of drug users, one on a methadone maintenance programme\n            and the other on a minimization of harm programme in relation to their quality of\n            life (QOL) and psychological status. Here we were examining the type of group as being\n            causal for QOL and psychological status. A minimization of harm programme has by its\n            nature more chaotic clients than a methadone maintenance programme so any group differences\n            may not be due to the services or treatment that they receive. However, the study\n            is still worthwhile. QOL and psychological status were measured by indicator variables.\n            For QOL the UK short form 36 scale health survey questionnaire (\n11\n) was used, which is divided into scores on eight dimensions of daily life. The dimensions\n            were summarized using effect size as described by Fayers and Hand. Clients on the\n            minimization of harm programme had a poorer perception of their QOL than those in\n            the methadone maintenance group. Psychological morbidity was measured using the hospital\n            anxiety and depression scale (\n21\n). This scale is psychometric in nature. Some psychological morbidity was found in\n            both groups though the minimization of harm group scored worse. The two groups also\n            differed significantly in the severity of drug use. However, the study highlighted\n            the fact that drug use (i.e. both groups) had an associated risk for psychological\n            and physical comorbidity, which has major implications for the development of ser\u2010\n            vices and treatment programmes, provision of education programmes and in the planning\n            of suicide preventive strategies. In addition the type of group is causal for QOL\n            and psychological status and this indicates that services should be targeted to the\n            group's needs. Thus in terms of intervention the identification of causal variables\n            is crucial. This interpretation of our paper became clear after reading that of Fayers\n            and Hand.\nOn a smaller point we preferred to use the term perception of QOL rather than QOL\n            to avoid incon\u2010 sistencies.\nS. C. Morton\n(\nRAND Statistics Group, Santa Monica\n)\nThe primary example in this stimulating paper brings to mind a parallel, and I would\n            venture equally as difficult, measurement task encountered in health services research.\n            Fayers and Hand focus on measuring quality of life (QOL). A similar challenge is evaluating\n            the quality of care (QOC) offered by health care providers.\nMost QOC assessment is based on\n5\n) model of structure, process and outcome. To paraphrase\n4\n), structural data encompass physician and hospital characteristics, process variables\n            describe the encounter between the physician and patient, and outcome data address\n            the patient's subsequent health status. Process variables may be most easily collected,\n            perhaps retrospectively from medical records, and thus are often used for an evaluation\n            of QOC. An example might be `do asthmatic patients cared for at this hospital receive\n            a yearly flu shot?'. Structural data are used in concert with process variables; perhaps\n            the hospital organizational system facilitates the delivery of inoculation. In contrast,\n            collecting outcome data such as hospitalization due to a severe episode of asthma\n            brought on by flu might prove difficult and costly. Questions remain with either approach.\n            For example, does a reliance on process measures increase the cost of medical care\n            without an associated improvement in health? Or, can much of the variability in outcomes\n            be explained by characteristics of the patient, which are beyond the reach of the\n            health care system?\nIf process measures are to be effective as QOC criteria, then their relationship with\n            outcomes must be demonstrated. Emphasis on evidence\u2010based medicine (\n16\n) has promoted establishing\nexternal\nmodels, e.g. by the analysis of prospective data, to use the terminology of Fayers\n            and Hand. Alternatively, when an empirical model cannot be constructed to determine\n            the predictive power of process on health outcomes, the relationship is motivated\n            by a\nclinimetric\napproach, generally relying on expert judgment obtained via a group process (\n12\n).\nSeveral different process measures may be identified with which to assess the QOC\n            delivered.\nPsychometric\nprinciples are often used to determine how to combine these different measures into\n            a single scale. Interestingly, as Fayers and Hand point out has been done in the QOL\n            setting, QOC researchers intuitively leave subscales, such as those containing diagnostic\n            and therapeutic items, distinct.\nThe wide\u2010ranging applicability of this paper makes it relevant to both QOC and QOL\n            research.\nIrini Moustaki\n(\nLondon School of Economics and Political Science\n)\nI would like to draw attention to some latent variable models within the item response\n            theory (IRT) framework that allow for causal effects.\n17\n) discussed a factor analysis model for mixed binary and normal indicators that allows\n            for causal effects on the latent variables and\n13\n) has proposed an IRT model for ordinal indicators with causal effects. Furthermore,\n            we can distinguish between covariates that are causal for the latent variables and\n            covariates that account for the associations between the observed indicators together\n            with the latent variables (direct effects).\nFactor analysis models that allow for causal and direct effects may be defined as\n            follows. Let us denote by a\np\n\u00d71 vector\ny\nthe observed indicators which may be of any type (binary, nominal, ordinal or metric)\n            and by a\nq\n\u00d71 vector\nz\nthe latent variables. We allow for a\nk\n\u00d71 vector of observed covariates\nx\nthat directly affect the observed indicators\ny\nand also for an\ns\n\u00d71 vector\nw\nof covariates (causal variables) that affect the vector of latent variables\nz\n.\nThe model is fitted using an EM algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimators\n            from the marginal distribution of the indicators. To apply the EM method we need the\n            likelihood of the joint distribution of the observed indicators\ny\nand the latent variables\nz\n. For a random sample of size\nn\nthe log\u2010likelihood is written as\nA detailed discussion of the estimation can be found in\n17\n) and\n13\n).\nThe assumption of conditional independence embedded in the model is that the vectors\nz\nand\nx\naccount for all associations between the observed indicators\ny\n. The conditional distribution of\ng\n(\ny\ni\nj\n|\nz\nj\n,\nx\nj\n) is allowed to take any form from the exponential family. The relationship between\n            the latent variables\nz\nand the observed causal covariates\nw\nis expressed in a simple linear form:\nwhere\nz\nis a\nq\n\u00d71 vector,\n\u0393\nis a\nq\n\u00d7\ns\nmatrix of regression coefficients and\n\u03b4\nis a\nq\n\u00d71 vector of independent standard normal variables. Equation (2) allows for a shift\n            in the location to the latent variables by\n\u0393w\nbut the scale of the latent variables is fixed at 1 to allow for model identification.\nIn addition, for identifiability, variables\nx\nmust be different from variables\nw\n.\nE. M. Scott, A. M. Nolan, J. Reid and J. Fitzpatrick\n(\nUniversity of Glasgow\n)\nThe principle of the development of a scale or index for quality of life has application\n            beyond the human case and becomes potentially even more difficult when dealing with\n            situations where observers must be used to rate the attribute. Our interest lies in\n            the application of and extensions to human quality of life required to develop clinical\n            pain scales and welfare indices successfully in both companion and farm animal settings.\n            Such scales and indices are vital in the veterinary setting given the increasing public\n            concern about animal welfare and the trend in the clinical setting towards controlled\n            trials, e.g. for efficacy of analgesic drugs. The potential set of items under consideration\n            includes behavioural, physiological and biochemical markers which are quite diverse,\n            representing the different aspects of the phenomena under study. There is no standard\n            and in our research we have explored\ninternal\nscales by using a potential heterogeneous set of items. For the clinical acute pain\n            setting, we have developed a questionnaire with eight categories (all behavioural,\n            since in a previous study we had shown that the physiological parameters did not correlate\n            with pain state (\n9\n) and a total of 37 items (\n8\n). All these items are indicator variables and we have used Thurstone's matched pairs\n            approach to evaluate the weights for each. For the clinical chronic pain setting,\n            we have used a questionnaire with over 100 items, with the owner completing the questionnaire\n            by indicating degree of agreement with each item by using a seven\u2010point Likert scale\n            (\n20\n). For the welfare scale, the variables to be incorporated include husbandry, behavioural\n            and physiological or biological measures (\n19\n). Thus only in the welfare setting have we both causal and indicator variables (and\n            indeed the causal variables may be sufficient cause for poor welfare, e.g. the presence\n            of disease or inadequate husbandry). The relative importance of the individual components\n            is assessed from an elicitation of expert opinion. In each case, we aim to create\n            a single composite measure but it is clear that the approaches taken to achieve this\n            in the pain and welfare arenas must differ.\nValidation (including reliability) is vital and extremely difficult to demonstrate;\n            practical utility requires acceptable interobserver reliability or generalizability\n            over observers. In our situation, the patient cannot give an assessment of their own\n            state, so the use of other raters' is not `dubious' but is the only solution. Interestingly,\n            there is a move to consider in some settings the use of self\u2010selection (e.g. in providing\n            pain relief), but this area still requires significant development before it becomes\n            an accepted alternative to the use of raters in the veterinary setting.\nThe\nauthors\nreplied later, in writing, as follows.\nWe are grateful for the simulating comments made about our paper.\nDavid Bartholomew's model is a nice encapsulation of the structure that we are promoting\n            and, at first glance, his driving test analogy is a compelling illustration of why\n            only the indicator variables should be included in the summary measure. However, this\n            example is based on the assumption that the model is well specified and, in particular,\n            that it includes all aspects of the latent variable among the indicator variables.\n            Although this is an ideal towards which we should strive, we suggest that it will\n            generally be optimistic to suppose that it has been achieved.\nTo illustrate this point, we continue with Bartholomew's driving test analogy and\n            imagine someone, with weak eyesight and poor hand\u2013eye co\u2010ordination, both of which\n            might be regarded as causal for driving ability. Let us begin with an extreme case,\n            and suppose that nothing else has been measured\u2014in particular, that no indicator variables\n            have been measured. In these circumstances might we not decide that this person's\n            driving ability would probably be poor\u2014and perhaps construct a clinimetric driving\n            ability by combining eyesight and co\u2010ordination scores in some way?\nNow let us relax this extreme example. Suppose that a driving test has also been administered,\n            but that this test consists merely of the ability to reverse into a parking slot\u2014so\n            that the score on this test is an indicator variable. It seems clear that this test,\n            although providing additional information about driving ability, does not subsume\n            all the information contained in the two `causal' variables of eyesight and co\u2010ordination.\n            A more elaborate driving test will begin to cover such information\u2014but how do we decide\n            that it has all been covered? How do we decide that the causal variables contribute\n            nothing beyond the information provided in the test (indicator) variables? We would\n            need to be very confident that this was the case before attributing identical driving\n            abilities to two people who had identical driving test scores but different causal\n            variable scores.\nMoreover, as the contributions of both Professor Scott, Dr Nolan, Dr Reid and Dr Fitzpatrick\n            and Dr Morton illustrate, situations do arise where it may be difficult to tap directly\n            into indicator variables for the attribute being measured.\nWe entirely endorse David Jones's appeal for clearer reporting of the process and\n            rationale underlying the development of scales. All too often, new scales are created\n            with little explicit justification, validation or theoretical base. Progress in the\n            theoretical understanding of and therapeutic attacks on medical problems coexists\n            with advances in measurement technology, as it does in other areas of science. This\n            sort of thing is clearly especially important when existing scales are adapted for\n            special purposes. Making the choice of structure and weights explicit is essential\n            if others are to evaluate the choices, and perhaps to adapt them for their own purposes.\nAs usual, David Cox puts his finger on a key feature of the ideas, and one that may\n            not be readily apparent. A fundamental difference between quality\u2010of\u2010life (QOL) measurement\n            and the phenomena measured in psychometric and educational situations is the importance\n            of the individual items in the former, but the lack of interest in the individual\n            items in the latter. This is the essence of clinimetric measurements, in that they\n            seek to summarize multiple attributes by using a single index.\nWe agree with Niels Keiding that we need an expression for QOL\nper se\n, so that we can then investigate possible relationships with causal variables, but\n            our aim in this paper is how to formulate that initial expression for QOL. Perhaps\n            it was inappropriate, as David Cox suggests, for us to use the adjective `causal'\n            to describe those aspects of QOL which are not indicators of it. Perhaps an alternative\n            would be the word `definitional' rather than causal: if the score on such a variable\n            is high, then there is a higher probability that the QOL score will be low.\nWe are grateful to David Firth for his generalization of the Blalock model and for\n            the illustration of its use, and to Michael Dewey for his example of a situation where\n            a direct question relating to QOL has been asked.\nWe made no pretence, in this paper, of answering all of the many challenging questions\n            hinging around QOL measurement. Our aim was, rather, to stimulate discussion, and\n            perhaps to move the debate forwards a little. It is therefore particularly pleasing\n            that Gabrielle Kelly found our classification of the variables into two types of practical\n            value.\nWe were delighted to see that similar issues have arisen in other domains, as Sally\n            Morton points out in her summary of quality\u2010of\u2010care assessment. The process variables\n            measured there, however, seem to be being used as alternatives or proxies for the\n            outcomes. A remaining question is whether such process measures contribute anything\n            to the overall quality of care beyond those aspects that are measured by outcomes,\n            in situations when both can be measured.\nIrini Moustaki's model is a valuable extension of ours, though at least in our application\n            it, also, faces the problems of determining into which of the\nx\n\u2010,\ny\n\u2010 and\nw\n\u2010categories the manifest variables each fall.\nJane Hutton raises an important point in research studies which use multiple QOL measures,\n            as opposed to clinical applications. We agree that this is an underrated source of\n            potential bias.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

Essentially similar trends are observed in the two taxa.\n         Experiments have shown that climate warming could result in higher rates of population\n         growth and have positive effects on the abundance of some temperate species. This\n         is consistent with signs of northward expansion in Europe, although the mechanisms\n         of dispersal remain unclear.

The Panel's assumption that respondents\n            in health state valuation (HSV) exercises take income losses into account could not\n            be countered since there was no evidence regarding what people consider in HSV exercises.\n            If they do consider income losses and if this changes HSVs, then all economic evaluations\n            that have included PC in the numerator may have double\u2010counted these costs. Alternatively,\n            if respondents do not consider income losses then all past economic evaluations that\n            have not included PC in the numerator have failed to account for sizeable societal\n            costs.\nObjectives:\nThrough a review we aim to recapture the debate surrounding the appropriate method\n            for including PC in health economic evaluations, to identify empirical evidence addressing\n            the assumptions of the Panel, and recommend a future research agenda.\nMethods:\nThrough a review we identify, outline, and critically appraise the existing empirical\n            studies that attempt to address whether respondents include income effects in HSV\n            exercises.\nResults and conclusion:\nSeven empirical studies were identified. Overall, it seems that not explicitly mentioning\n            the inclusion of income will induce a minority of respondents to include these effects\n            and this appears not to influence results. More empirical work is needed, using generic\n            instruments, larger samples, and using the interview method of administration.\nIntroduction\nEconomic evaluations increasingly influence decisions on the allocation of scarce\n            resources within the health\u2010care sector. The general idea behind these economic evaluations\n            is that health\u2010care programs should offer sufficient value for money in order to warrant\n            their funding. In order to properly determine the value for money of health\u2010care programs,\n            from the societal point of view, it is pivotal that all relevant costs and effects\n            are included in the evaluation in an appropriate way.\nOne area of particular debate is that of productivity costs, which have been defined\n            as \u201ccosts associated with production loss and replacement costs due to illness, disability\n            and death of productive persons, both paid and unpaid\u201d\n1\n. In a Cost\u2010effectiveness Analysis, changes in productivity costs were typically valued\n            in monetary terms in the numerator of the cost\u2010effectiveness ratio (C/E) through either\n            the human capital (HC) or friction cost (FC) method. However, in 1996, the Washington\n            Panel argued that productivity costs are, and indeed should be, included in the denominator\n            of the C/E ratio\n2\n. They are included as health effects according to the Panel, because in health state\n            valuation (HSV) exercises respondents are assumed to consider the effect that a health\n            state will have on income (and these income losses act as a proxy for productivity\n            costs) even when the valuation method is silent regarding income. To include productivity\n            costs in the numerator of the C/E ratio in monetary terms, as commonly done, would\n            result in double\u2010counting these costs, which should obviously be avoided. Alternatively,\n            if respondents do not (consistently) consider income effects in HSVs or if the influence\n            of such considerations on the valuations is negligible, then economic evaluations\n            using the Washington Panel Approach have excluded real and sizeable societal costs.\n            Therefore, to ensure a good distinction between costs and effects in health economic\n            evaluations, in order to avoid double\u2010counting and ensure the inclusion of real societal\n            costs, it is pivotal to determine what respondents consider in HSV exercises.\nBy now, empirical evidence on this issue has become available. Studies on whether\n            respondents consider income in HSVs when these are silent on this matter have been\n            published. Some of these studies also consider the influence of providing respondents\n            with explicit information on income losses associated with a given health state or\n            with explicit instructions on the inclusion or exclusion of possible income changes.\n            These studies thus all directly address the issue of inclusion of income losses in\n            HSVs, which is central in the recommendations made by the Washington Panel.\nIn this review article we do not add to the existing empirical work. We first outline\n            the different approaches to valuing productivity costs in economic evaluations. We\n            then present the findings of existing empirical studies that have attempted to determine\n            whether or not respondents in HSV exercises consider income effects. In doing so,\n            we will consider the implications of the results for the inclusion of productivity\n            costs and the elicitation of HSVs in economic evaluation. Moreover, we will expose\n            unresolved issues and hence research priorities for the future. In contrast to previous\n            studies\n3\n-\n5\n, this article covers the recent empirical developments on the inclusion of income\n            changes in HSVs.\nBackground\nThe inclusion of productivity costs in economic evaluations has been and still is\n            controversial. When a broad societal perspective is adopted, as is often recommended\n2\n,\n6\n, and which follows logically from the welfare theoretical roots of economic evaluations\n7\n, all costs and effects should be considered in an analysis. In this article we do\n            not address the normative question of whether productivity costs should be included\n            in economic evaluations. Rather, we simply address the issue of\nhow\nto include them in an appropriate way, focusing on the question of whether productivity\n            costs (or rather income changes) are, or can, be included in HSVs.\nHealth economic evaluations normally take the specific form of cost\u2010effectiveness\n            analyses or, preferably, cost\u2010utility analyses. The latter type of analysis uses the\n            Quality\u2010adjusted Life Year, or QALY gained\n8\nas a measure of health improvements. Importantly, these analyses, unlike traditional\n            cost\u2010benefit analyses, require the determination of what is counted as a health effect\n            (nonmonetarily) and what as costs. Moreover, as in any analysis, double\u2010counting of\n            impacts needs to be avoided and an adequate measurement and valuation method needs\n            to be applied. In that context, it was (and largely still is) common practice and\n            considered most appropriate to incorporate productivity costs in the analysis as costs\n            in the numerator of the cost\u2010utility ratio. However, in 1996 the Washington Panel\n            controversially recommended the inclusion of productivity costs almost entirely through\n            HSVs and therefore in terms of quality of life (QoL) in the denominator of the C/E\n            ratio\n2\n.\nValuing Productivity Costs in Monetary Terms\u2014The Human Capital (HC) and Friction Cost\n               (FC) Methods\nTwo main methods for valuing productivity costs existed before the US Panel proposed\n               their \u201cthird way.\u201d The first is the HC approach\n9\n,\n10\n. Under this approach lost production (often related to paid work) as a result of\n               morbidity or mortality is valued by measuring time lost from work and multiplying\n               this with the gross wage of the involved individual. Economic theory suggests that\n               under certain conditions, at the margin, gross wages equal the productive value of\n               individuals, so that this multiplication should yield a good estimate of the value\n               of lost production. The relevant period of time over which costs (or savings) are\n               measured is, unless restricted by the time horizon of the analysis, the total period\n               of time in which a person is (un)able to be productive compared to the alternative\n               scenario. In the case of disability or premature death this can obviously amount to\n               many years i.e., until the retirement age would have been reached. If a 45\u2010year\u2010old\n               individual earning \u00a330,000 per year became unable to work due to permanent disability,\n               the estimated value of productivity losses under the HC method (assuming a retirement\n               age of 65) would be: 20\u2003\u00d7\u2003\u00a330,000, i.e., \u00a3600,000. For examples of economic evaluations\n               that have used the HC approach, see Beutels et\u2003al.\n11\n, Ford et\u2003al.\n12\n, and Kobelt et\u2003al.\n13\n.\nThe neoclassical theory on which the HC approach is based assumes that all markets\n               clear. However, in reality the existence of involuntary unemployment means that when\n               someone is forced to leave the workforce due to illness they can be replaced by a\n               previously unemployed person. To be able to explicitly value productivity costs from\n               a societal perspective and in relation to economic circumstances, the FC method was\n               developed\n14\n-\n16\n. Under this approach the period in which productivity costs occur is limited to the\n               time it takes to replace a worker. The FC method argues that, from a societal point\n               of view, there are no production losses in the long run, since the production loss\n               in the ill, disabled, or deceased worker is cancelled out by a production gain in\n               the new, formerly unemployed, worker. Estimates of the value of productivity change\n               according to the FC method do include some additional costs such as the resource cost\n               associated with recruiting and training replacement workers (e.g., advertising the\n               job vacancy). Unsurprisingly, the estimates of the FC and HC methods do not differ\n               significantly for short\u2010term absence\n17\n. However, in the case of mortality and long term morbidity these differences are\n               substantial. The estimated value of productivity losses for society in the case of\n               an individual permanently disabled, mentioned above, would be considerably lower for\n               the FC method than for the HC method. If it took 1 year to find a replacement worker,\n               and there were advertising and training costs of \u00a310,000, the total cost would be\n               \u00a340,000 (vs. \u00a3600,000 in the HC approach). For examples of economic evaluations that\n               have used the FC approach, see Glick et\u2003al.\n18\n, Van Enckevort et\u2003al.\n19\n, and Nord et\u2003al.\n20\n. The criticism of the FC method mainly relates to the valuation of leisure time;\n               see Johannesson and Karlson\n21\n, Liljas\n22\n, Koopmanschap et\u2003al.\n23\n, Johannesson\n24\n, and Brouwer et\u2003al.\n25\n.\nValuing Productivity Costs as Part of the Health Effects: The Washington Panel Approach\nThe Panel asserts that in valuing imperfect health states, respondents will consider\n               their productivity and income level. In other words, the Panel assumes that when answering\n               HSV questions (for example, the Time Trade\u2010off [TTO]\n26\n) respondents will take account of the effect a potential health state will have not\n               only on their\nability\nto work as a form of role functioning\n25\nbut also on their income. The Panel thus proposes that productivity costs can, should,\n               and, in fact, already are included in utility scores for imperfect health states.\n               Most HSV instruments are silent on the topic of income changes (with the exception\n               of the Health Utilities Index [HUI] instruments), but the Panel argues this is sufficient\n               for inclusion of these effects. It is worth noting that the Panel does not deny the\n               possibility of replacement of ill workers. It recommends replacement costs be calculated\n               and included in the numerator. For an example of an economic evaluation that has used\n               the Washington Panel Approach, see Wang et\u2003al.\n27\n.\nIf we assume that respondents in health states valuations on average lower their valuation\n               of some health state by 0.05 (on a scale with 1 for full health and 0 for dead) and\n               the permanently disabled individual lives for another 20 years to become 65, then\n               one additional QALY is being lost (i.e., 20\u2003\u00d7\u20030.05). A treatment that will enable\n               him to return to work will thus gain one additional QALY relative to QALYs gained\n               without income being considered.\nThe Washington Panel Approach has received considerable criticism. An individual's\n               income may be a poor proxy for his productivity and hence the stable relationship\n               implicitly assumed by the Panel may not exist\n1\n,\n25\n,\n28\n. Productivity changes may not cause income changes proportional to productivity changes\n               if social benefits (or payments from private insurance) are received to compensate\n               for the reduction in labor income. Thus, the impact of productivity on income may\n               fluctuate with age (e.g., after retirement, income is likely to be independent of\n               productivity). It may also be difficult for respondents to accurately predict how\n               (generic) health states affect productivity and, consequently, income. Moreover, illness\n               may cause productivity losses without absence (i.e., reduced productivity at work\n               or \u201cpresenteeism\u201d). Brouwer et\u2003al.\n1\nargued that adoption of the Washington Panel Approach would lead to an omission of\n               these costs since these productivity losses often do not translate into income losses.\n               Furthermore, Meltzer and Johannesson\n29\nnote that if people (are to) incorporate personal financial consequences such as\n               income losses into QALY weights, they will presumably also incorporate other consequences\n               such as out\u2010of\u2010pocket medical expenses related to, for example, pharmaceuticals or\n               hospitalization (whenever relevant) and the value of time forgone participating in\n               health interventions. However, since the Panel advises including both of these factors\n               in measures of costs, this would then result in double\u2010counting. Further criticism\n               of the Washington Panel Approach, such as the failure to take account of the income\n               gain achieved by the previously unemployed member of society, can be found in Brouwer\n               et\u2003al.\n1\n. In general, it seems likely that respondents in HSV exercises take an individual\n               rather than a societal perspective, so that costs and gains in others (employers,\n               replacement workers, etc) will remain unvalued.\nIn or Out? Empirical Studies So Far\nTo our knowledge seven empirical studies on this issue have been published so far\n30\n-\n36\n. To confirm there were no other studies that we were unaware of we performed a Medline\n            search (via Pubmed). We used a title and abstract search with the following terms:\n            \u201chealth state valuation OR TTO OR SG OR VAS OR quality of life AND (lost income OR\n            income effects OR income loss OR productivity costs) AND consider OR included OR inclusion\n            OR instruction OR double\u2010counting.\u201d This gave 297 results. The inclusion criteria\n            were any study that had empirically tested the inclusion of income in HSVs. All but\n            one of the studies that we were aware of appeared in the search. The one that did\n            not appear\n30\nis only available as an abstract, and hence does not appear in Medline. We did not\n            find any other empirical studies.\nTable\u20031\nprovides an overview of the key findings and characteristics of the seven empirical\n            studies.\nTable 1.\nSummary of empirical studies\nStudy\nMethod of preference elicitation\nHealth states valued\nSample Size\nSample demographic\nLocation\nSpontaneously included income effects\nMean score spontaneously considering/not considering income\nMean score informed/uninformed on income\u2010effects\nMean score explicitly instructed to include/exclude income\nMeltzer, Weckerle, and Chang (1999)\n30\nTTO\nBlindness and back pain\n831\nPatients\nUnited States\n<15\u201325%\nNA\nNo info/60% DP/no DP\nNA\nBlindness: 4.95/4.83/4.84\nBack pain: 5.09/5.78\n*\n/4.25\n\u2020\nSendi and Bouwer (2005)\n31\nVAS\nMultiple sclerosis\n20\nHealth professionals\nSwitzerland\n40%\n31.25/48.33\n\u2020\nNA\nNA\nKrol, Brouwer, and Sendi (2006)\n32\nVAS\nEQ\u20105D\n185\nGeneral population\nThe Netherlands\n36%\nState 1: 0.68/0.69\nNA\nState 1: 0.68/0.65\n21211\nState 2: 0.53/0.49\nState 2: 0.49/0.48\n22221\nState 3: 0.32/0.28\nState 3: 0.27/0.30\n33312\nMyers, McCabe, and Gohmann (2007)\n33\nSG\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\n181\nUndergraduate students\nUnited States\nNA\nNA\nMild: 0.832/0.903\n*\n\u2020\u2021\nModerate: 0.686/0.796\n*\n\u2021\nSevere: 0.626/0.743\n*\n\u2021\nNA\nRichardson, Peacock and Lezzi (2009)\n34\nTTO\nVisual impairment\n131\nPatients and general population\nAustralia\n38%\nOnly significant result was counterintuitive\nNA\nNA\nKrol, Sendi and Brouwer (2009)\n35\nTTO\nEQ\u20105D\n210\nGeneral population\nThe Netherlands\n64%\nState 1: 0.89/0.86\nNA\nState 1: 0.91/0.91\n21211\nState 2: 0.72/0.70\nState 2: 0.72/0.74\n22221\nState 3: 0.41/0.35\nState 3: 0.38/0.45\n33312\nDavidson and Levine (2008)\n36\nVAS and TTO\nEQ\u20105D\n200\nUndergraduate students\nSweden\n6%\nNot presented in article\nNA\nSignificant differences\n\u00a7\n:\n11211\nTTO: 2 states\n11122\n21232\nVAS: 3 states\n33321\n*\nSignificant at 10% level.\n\u2020\nSignificant at 5% level.\n\u2021\nSignificant at 1% level.\n\u00a7\nNo instruction compared with ex post exclusion.

Respondents were randomly assigned one of three different versions of TTO:\n            in version 0, no guidance was given about financial consequences; in version 1, respondents\n            were told that 60% of their current income would be provided as disability payments;\n            and in version 2, they were told that there would be no disability payments. When\n            questioned after the TTO, of respondents presented with version 0 of the questionnaire,\n            less than 15% indicated they had considered the financial consequences of either health\n            state valued. This means that what has been labeled as \u201cspontaneous inclusion\u201d of\n            income when the TTO question is silent on the issue is relatively uncommon, unlike\n            the suggestion of the Panel. Even for version 2, this figure was still less than 25%.\nOne would expect version 2 to elicit the lowest value, while making predictions for\n            versions 0 and 1 is more difficult. However, given that so few people include income\n            effects, even in version 2, any differences between the versions are likely to be\n            small. The mean TTO scores for blindness were 4.95, 4.83, and 4.84 for versions 0,\n            1, and 2 respectively (insignificant). The mean TTO scores for back pain were 5.09,\n            5.78, and 4.25 for versions 0, 1, and 2, respectively. When comparing with version\n            0, the results for back pain were significantly different at the 10% and 5% significance\n            levels for versions 1 and 2, respectively. Unfortunately the differences in results\n            between those that did and did not consider income effects are not presented. The\n            significant results for back pain confirm that version 2 elicits the lowest utility\n            value. However, the relatively high value for version 1 (back pain) is somewhat surprising,\n            which demonstrates the need for further exploration of why subjects responded to the\n            HSV exercises in the way that they did.\nThe main conclusion of the authors is that the \u201ceconomic costs of illness are unlikely\n            to be reflected in QoL questions, so these need to be counted separately\u201d (p. 517).\n            Furthermore they argue that \u201cit may be best to instruct people to ignore the economic\n            consequences of illness in answering QoL questions\u201d (p. 517). Explicit instructions\n            were proposed as a means of \u201cbreaking the silence\u201d in order to ensure consistency\n            between respondents regarding what they consider in conventional HSVs. This study\n            was only published as an abstract, in which the specific survey method is not mentioned,\n            the exact scale of the TTO values is not explained, and no background characteristics\n            of the sample are given (age and occupation would be particularly useful in interpreting\n            income effects).\nA second study was performed by Sendi and Brouwer\n31\n, who presented 20 health professionals (5 medical doctors, 2 medical researchers,\n            and 13 nurses), in Switzerland, with a questionnaire that described the health status\n            of a 30\u2010year\u2010old male patient suffering from multiple sclerosis. They were asked to\n            rate the health state on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (worst possible\n            health) to 100 (best possible health). The questionnaire was silent on the condition's\n            effect on income (as well as on leisure). After answering the VAS question (the \u201cex\n            ante valuation\u201d), respondents were asked whether the impact ill health may have on\n            income was included in their valuation. If respondents gave a negative response, they\n            were explicitly asked to consider income (and leisure) effects in the valuation of\n            the health state in an identical second VAS question (\u201cex post valuation\u201d), but the\n            actual magnitude of income loss was not specified.\nThe results show that 60% of respondents did not consider the effects of ill\u2010health\n            on income in the first instance (i.e., when the measure was silent), and, as expected,\n            those who did not consider income had a significantly higher mean VAS score compared\n            with those who did consider income (48.33 vs. 31.25), although these groups also varied\n            in terms of the inclusion of leisure. The ex post valuation for those respondents\n            who did not include leisure and income in the first round was significantly lower\n            than their ex ante valuation, but this effect seems especially to be driven by leisure\n            considerations. As acknowledged by the authors, this study has a small sample size\n            weakening any potential conclusions. Also, in this study, background characteristics\n            of the sample are not provided. The study moreover used a VAS as the valuation component.\n            Since the aim was to find out whether people would include income effects in conventional\n            valuation exercises, the VAS was anchored to best and worst imaginable health, meaning\n            that, conceptually, only if respondents consider income to be a part of health would\n            they include it in valuations on this scale.\nA third study was that by Krol and colleagues\n32\n. They administered HSV questionnaires, using a similar VAS scale as Sendi and Brouwer\n31\ndid, to 227 members of the general population in The Netherlands. Besides looking\n            at spontaneous inclusion of income (and leisure), this study also addressed the topic\n            of the effects of explicit prior instructions regarding inclusion of income effects\n            on HSVs. The aim of the study therefore was to test: 1) whether or not respondents\n            spontaneously include the effect of ill health on income (and leisure); 2) the impact\n            on the valuation of inclusion (or exclusion) of income effects; and 3) the influence\n            of explicit instruction on this matter. To test this, three versions of the questionnaire\n            were administered. The first version included no directions and those who spontaneously\n            included income effects were asked to revalue the state again but excluding these\n            effects. (Note that this is exactly opposite to the ex post valuation in Sendi and\n            Brouwer\n31\n, who asked people who\ndid not\ninclude income in the ex ante phase, to revalue the health states now\nincluding\nincome. Moreover, the ex post valuation now pertained to income only, not leisure).\n            In the second version respondents were explicitly instructed up front to incorporate\n            income effects in their valuations, while in the third version respondents on the\n            contrary were explicitly instructed to assume that income would not change. Each respondent\n            answered all three versions. Respondents valued three health states described by the\n            EuroQol descriptive system (EQ\u20105D)\n37\n: mild (21211), medium (22221), and severe (33312). The EQ\u20105D has five dimensions\n            (mobility, self\u2010care, daily activities, pain, and depression) and three levels in\n            each, so it can describe a total of 243 different health states. Therefore, the mild\n            state above has moderate problems in the first and third dimensions and no problems\n            in the other dimensions.\nA total of 185 questionnaires were useful for further analysis. The authors acknowledge\n            that the relatively high number of noncompleted questionnaires (18.5%) suggests that\n            HSVs may be difficult to understand for members of the general public, and an oral\n            instruction may have been beneficial. The average age of the sample was 35 (SD 13),\n            which is younger than that of the general population, which may be important if younger\n            people would be less or more concerned about potential income losses due to ill health.\n            Moreover, 22% of the respondents did not have paid work. This implies that these respondents\n            do not experience income losses in the event of illness. Furthermore, 51% of the sample\n            had a higher level of education (vocational colleges and academic education), and\n            49% had a relatively high income (>$1900 per month). As the authors acknowledge, such\n            a sample is not representative of the general public, which may lead to biased results.\n            For instance, one might expect more educated respondents to give more thought to the\n            valuation exercise and fully consider the potential consequences of a given state,\n            and hence be more likely to consider income effects. On the other hand, they might\n            also think more about the concept of health and purposely leave out income effects\n            from the valuation on a VAS measuring\nhealth\n. In the case of higher income respondents, these may be more likely to exhibit noticeable\n            income effects, since they stand to lose more money in absolute terms due to ill health,\n            but on the other hand, they may normally have jobs in which at least some forms of\n            health problems will less quickly influence their productivity. Therefore, making\n            clear predictions about the influence of these background characteristics is quite\n            difficult.\nFor the experiment of comparing the three versions of the questionnaire, the biased\n            sample should have had little effect on the results since the groups that did and\n            did not consider income (both instructed and spontaneously) did not differ in this\n            respect. In the absence of instruction 36% of respondents included income effects\n            (comparable to the results of Sendi and Brouwer\n31\nabove), but valuations of the two groups were not significantly different (contradicting\n            the findings of Meltzer and colleagues\n30\nand Sendi and Brouwer\n31\n). When those that indicated that they had considered income effects in version 1\n            were asked to repeat the exercise assuming no income effects, no significant differences\n            in valuations were observed in the case of state 1. This is not surprising, given\n            that the majority of respondents did not think this state would reduce their income.\n            In the case of states 2 and 3, valuations did change significantly (revised upwards).\n            However, over half of the respondents did not change their valuations (which were\n            also observed for income effects in the study of Sendi and Brouwer\n31\n) and this held for all three states. Across all respondents there were no significant\n            differences between valuations using version 2 or version 3, suggesting that explicit\n            instruction does not matter in the sense that it does not change the overall results,\n            and this again holds for all three health states. Therefore, instructing respondents\n            to either include or exclude income effects in their HSVs in this study did not result\n            in a noticeable difference between the groups. This casts serious doubts on whether\n            the Washington Panel Approach to valuing productivity costs is accurate. The authors\n            acknowledge that using VAS as a valuation technique may have driven the results somewhat,\n            as it may be expected to be relatively insensitive to income effects when respondents\n            do not consider this a part of health.\nKrol and colleagues\n35\nattempt to replicate their first study now using the TTO method. This method is not\n            only better accepted as a valuation technique for health states, but also conceptually,\n            it may allow respondents to more easily consider broader consequences of illness,\n            like income changes, in their valuations. In this study, Krol and colleagues used\n            the same three versions of the questionnaire as above (no mention of income, explicit\n            inclusion of income effects, and explicit exclusion of these effects), aim to test\n            the same hypotheses and ask people to value the same three EQ\u20105D health states. A\n            total of 210 members of the general public in The Netherlands participated in the\n            study. For version 1, when there was no mention of income loss, 64% of respondents\n            spontaneously included these effects (a much higher value than previous studies),\n            but as with the study by Krol and colleagues\n34\nthere were no significant differences in valuations between the respondents who did\n            and those who did not spontaneously include income. When those that indicated that\n            they had included income effects in version 1 in the ex ante valuation were asked\n            to repeat the exercise assuming no income effects, the ex post valuation showed no\n            significant differences compared to the ex ante. Comparing responses to versions 2\n            and 3, the finding of Krol and colleagues\n32\nwere confirmed: that no significant differences between these versions occur. As\n            with the study by Krol and colleagues\n32\nthe average age of the sample was quite low (35) and a large proportion did not have\n            paid work (28%), but again, within the experiment these characteristics cannot explain\n            the results. The authors furthermore stress that some results may have been insignificant\n            due to a lack of statistical power, owing to the relatively small convenience sample\n            used (although this is the second largest sample of the studies identified). Also,\n            the TTO questions are framed in such a manner that may lead respondents to believe\n            they can only make a minimum trade of 1 year. This is likely to effect the values\n            obtained, especially in the case of the mildest state (21211), but again, it is unlikely\n            that this has had an influence on the comparisons made within this study.\nRichardson and colleagues\n34\nperformed a study in Australia, also using the TTO method. Individuals who had completed\n            TTO interviews as part of the construction of the Vision Quality of Life Index (VisQoL)\n            multi\u2010attribute utility instrument\n38\nwere questioned about their assumptions concerning income and the amount of thought\n            given to income during a TTO interview. A total of 28 different multi\u2010attribute health\n            states were valued. The two hypotheses they aimed to test were: 1) when there is no\n            explicit statement about income in the exercise the majority of TTO respondents will\n            assume that in a very poor health state their incomes will fall; and 2) TTO scores\n            will be lower when subjects assume that their incomes will fall. The sample consisted\n            of 70 visually impaired patients and 61 members of the general population. After completion\n            of the TTO interview an \u201cincome\u201d questionnaire was administered to the population\n            group at follow\u2010up by post. Due to their visual impairment the questionnaire was administered\n            to the patient group as a face\u2010to\u2010face interview immediately after completion of their\n            TTO questions. The questionnaire first asked respondents how much thought they gave\n            to income and spending, with possible answers of \u201cno thought,\u201d\u201ca little thought,\u201d\n            or \u201ca lot of thought.\u201d Second, the respondents who had considered income and spending\n            were asked whether they assumed that their income would remain the same, would be\n            lower, or would be much lower.\nThe results showed that only 9.1% of the respondents gave a lot of thought to income\n            and spending, while 62% gave the issue no thought. While 38% of respondents did think\n            about income a little or a lot, only 26.7% of these believed their income would fall\n            a little or a lot, leading to a rejection of the first hypothesis. Ordinary least\n            squares regression was used to test the second hypothesis. The results suggested a\n            strong negative relationship between thinking a lot about income and the disutility\n            score (i.e., the more the respondents thought about income the higher their TTO value,\n            which is counterintuitive). However, the significance of this result disappeared in\n            the random effects model. Both regressions only showed a statistically significant\n            and lower disutility (i.e., a higher TTO score) associated with individuals who thought\n            a lot about income and assumed it would decrease a little. The authors conclude that\n            this perverse result is almost certainly attributable to the small number of respondents\n            (7) in this category. The most important conclusion of this study was that survey\n            respondents do not appear to have reduced their TTO estimates to take account of a\n            possible loss of income when their health state implies an inability to work. Unfortunately,\n            information on background characteristics was not presented. It would be particularly\n            useful to have information on age and occupation of the respondents to more incisively\n            assess the results obtained.\nA study was performed by Myers and colleagues\n33\n. This was the only study using the standard gamble (SG) method of preference elicitation\n            (for standard description of the SG method see Drummond et\u2003al.\n6\n). They administered a paper SG exercise to 181 undergraduate economics students in\n            the United States. The students were randomized into one of two groups. In group 1\n            no information was provided regarding income effects, while in group 2 participants\n            were simply informed that these effects might occur. Students were presented with\n            one of three health states based on differing degrees of carpal tunnel syndrome (mild,\n            moderate, and severe). These states were anchored to the loss of both hands rather\n            than the conventional approach of anchoring to death. The results showed that the\n            overall mean QoL for the group informed of the potential for income loss was lower\n            than subjects who were uninformed (\nP\n<\u20030.0001). For the mild state the mean valuation for the informed group was 0.832\n            compared with 0.903 for the uninformed group. For the severe state the means are 0.626\n            for the informed group compared to 0.743 for the uninformed group. Since differences\n            were found between the two groups the authors concluded that income losses are not\n            spontaneously included in the assessment of QoL weights. However, at the individual\n            level it seems quite plausible that some may have spontaneously included these costs\n            while others may not. Moreover, the mentioning of potential income loss may have increased\n            the idea of severity of the projected health state for the respondents. Background\n            characteristics of the sample were not presented, but since they were students they\n            were presumably relatively young and had relatively low incomes. As indicated earlier,\n            how this may have affected answers is difficult to predict. Also, since the health\n            states were anchored to the loss of both hands rather than death, the comparability\n            of the results with the other studies is questionable.\nMost recently, Davidson and Levin\n36\nasked 200 Swedish students to value four EQ\u20105D states (11211, 11122, 21232, and 33321),\n            through self\u2010complete VAS and TTO exercises. The students were randomly allocated\n            to one of two groups: either the income or nonincome group. The nonincome group received\n            no instruction regarding income while completing the valuations. This group was asked\n            a follow\u2010up question: did you consider your expected income when valuing the health\n            states? Those that stated that they had not included income effects were asked to\n            revalue the states, this time including expected income (ex post inclusion). The income\n            group received instructions to include effects on expected income. This group was\n            told to assume a specific gross income per month at full health. Four different income\n            levels were used, but each student only had one income level to consider.\nThe background characteristics of the study show that the two groups did not differ\n            significantly in any variable. In the non\u2010income group 94% of respondents did not\n            spontaneously include income effects. When these were asked to revalue the states\n            including income effects, the TTO valuations were significantly lower for two of the\n            four states, and the VAS valuations were significantly lower for three of the four\n            states. In the income group, 40% believed that thinking about their expected income\n            had affected their valuations of the health states. Students in the income group were\n            asked what percentage of their specified income in full health they would expect to\n            have in the health states. The mean expected income percentages in the four states\n            were 73%, 82%, 47%, and 30%. Interestingly, although state 11122 was valued lower\n            than state 11211, respondents felt that states 11211 would have a larger effect on\n            income. This suggests that the usual activities dimension is perceived to have the\n            greatest effect on income. Comparison of the two groups showed that the income group\n            gave significantly lower TTO valuations than the nonincome group for only the mildest\n            state. There were significantly lower VAS valuations among the income group for the\n            two most severe states. The main weakness of this study is that the sample consists\n            of students. The authors argue that students were used because they generally have\n            low, and similar, incomes but with increasing expected incomes in the future. However,\n            we would argue that students do not have mortgages or dependents and hence cannot\n            relate to the financial burden and the stress associated with potentially not being\n            able to meet these demands. Given this, it is unsurprising that 94% of respondents\n            did not spontaneously consider income effects. The approach of telling respondents\n            to assume a fixed given income in full health further complicates the exercises and\n            increases the cognitive burden. Ultimately, the authors argue that productivity costs\n            should be included in the numerator rather than the denominator of a cost\u2010effectiveness\n            analysis.\nIt is clear that the above studies draw inconsistent conclusions, use various preference\n            elicitation methods, samples and study designs, and often suffer from important weaknesses.\nDiscussion and Research Agenda\nWhile the Washington Panel recommendations may not have received much support, they\n            suggest that the line between costs and effects in health economic evaluations has\n            not been drawn carefully enough and, therefore, current methods may lead to double\u2010counting\n            when used in combination. Besides the empirical questions, a number of theoretical\n            issues in this debate remain unresolved. First, it is dubious whether income effects\n            can be considered a part of health effects, as suggested by the Washington Panel.\n            Second, the use of income as an accurate proxy for societal productivity costs is\n            questionable. These considerations may already lead to a preference for including\n            productivity costs on the cost\u2010side of the C/E ratio, but does not take away the need\n            to address the empirical questions of whether, and how, people take account of income\n            losses when valuing health states.\nThe currently available empirical evidence on this issue cannot be considered decisive\n            or conclusive. There are some inconsistencies between the conclusions of the existing\n            studies. On the topic of spontaneous inclusion of income effects, Meltzer and colleagues\n30\nand Sendi and Brouwer\n31\ndid find significant differences between valuations of respondents including/excluding\n            income effects, while Krol and colleagues\n32\n,\n35\nand Richardson and colleagues\n34\ndid not. The lower VAS scores found by Sendi and Brouwer\n31\namong those who considered income effects could be caused by the fact that the sample\n            was very small and consisted of health professionals. These are likely to have a better\n            understanding than the general public of the effect a given health state will have\n            on your ability to work and hence your income. Moreover, as in other studies, the\n            results may also have been affected by differences in considering leisure time between\n            respondents. It seems important to better control for differences in that respect.\n            The studies on explicit ex ante instruction regarding inclusion or exclusion of income\n            (but without specifying the size of the effect) are also inconclusive. Krol and colleagues\n32\n,\n35\nfound no significant differences. However, Davidson and Levine\n36\nfound that respondents instructed to include income effects gave significantly lower\n            valuations than those with no instructions in some cases. However, it seems that explicitly\n            mentioning (potential) income losses (but not telling respondents what to do with\n            this information) does affect HSV. The results presented by Meltzer and colleagues\n30\nfor back pain (although not for blindness) seem to indicate this, as well as the\n            results of Myers and colleagues\n33\nfor carpal tunnel syndrome. Such results may also indicate that explicit mentioning\n            of potential income losses may lead people to believe that the condition is more severe\n            than they first imagined or that they emphasize other aspects of work (such as role\n            functioning) in their subsequent valuation\n24\n.\nEmpirically, the clearest conclusion so far is that, without instructions, some people\n            do include income effects while others do not. The specific percentage of respondents\n            that incorporate these effects is less clear. Estimates range from 6% to 64% (when\n            income is not mentioned). This indicates that whether productivity costs are included\n            in the numerator or the denominator, they may be either under or over accounted for,\n            depending on the effect of inclusion of income effects on HSVs. If productivity costs\n            are included in the numerator\nand\nthe influence of income effects on HSVs is not negligible, then some double\u2010counting\n            will occur. Alternatively, if productivity costs are to be included in the denominator\n            then productivity costs will be under accounted for, since some people will not consider\n            income effects in their valuations (unless the influence on HSVs is unduly large).\n            Furthermore, if HSVs would indeed contain non\u2010negligible income effects, this poses\n            a problem when decision makers in certain jurisdictions do not wish to include productivity\n            costs in health economic evaluations in any way. The evidence so far, however, suggests\n            that possible double\u2010counting, given the current way of deriving HSVs (e.g., without\n            specifying the size of income effects) seems to be non\u2010existent or, at least, negligible,\n            given that most studies find no significant differences in values between those that\n            do and do not consider income effects when the measure is silent. Although explicit\n            instruction similarly seems to make little difference to valuations, for now the best\n            solution may be to explicitly exclude income effects and include productivity costs\n            in the numerator.\nThe studies identified in this article have various weaknesses and, while answering\n            some questions, have also resulted in new ones. Most studies have a limited sample\n            size and four out of the seven ask respondents to value specific health states (e.g.,\n            carpal tunnel syndrome) rather than generic health states. This is an important difference\n            as respondents may be able to imagine more easily the impact on their productivity\n            due to specific diseases than due to a general health profile. In terms of relevance,\n            it would especially be useful to understand income effects within generic instruments\n            as these are now the most commonly used metrics within economic evaluations and are\n            also used to form widely used population value sets. It is interesting to note that\n            all studies that have found significant differences in values have studied a specific\n            condition. Neither of the studies using a generic instrument, the EQ\u20105D, have found\n            any notable differences. This highlights the possibility that respondents may be able\n            to relate to a specific illness more easily and therefore may be more capable and\n            perhaps likely to envisage the broader consequences of such an illness. It seems important\n            to study the differences between generic and disease\u2010specific instruments further\n            in future research. The evidence seems to suggest that population value sets derived\n            using generic instruments such as the EQ\u20105D are not noticeably influenced or \u201cpolluted\u201d\n            by income effects and therefore can be used alongside monetary valuation methods of\n            productivity costs, as well as in contexts where income effects are to be excluded\n            from the analysis completely.\nAnother noteworthy issue may be the experience people may have (themselves or in others)\n            with some health state. Not only might this affect the valuation of that health state\n            in general, but it may also raise awareness of the broader consequences of illness\n            and therefore may affect the inclusion of such consequences. Therefore, future research\n            may study whether the influence of knowledge of a specific health state or disease\n            affects the likelihood of considering income effects in the valuation of that health\n            state and, indeed, the valuation itself.\nFive of the seven studies reviewed, with the notable exception of the visually impaired\n            patients in the Richardson and colleagues\n34\nstudy (while the mode of administration is not clear in the study by Meltzer and\n            colleagues\n30\n), use self\u2010complete questionnaires. Studies administering preference elicitation\n            through interviews, despite being more time consuming and expensive, would enable\n            researchers to gain a greater understanding of the thought processes at work when\n            respondents are answering the questions (perhaps through parallel qualitative probing).\nThere is undoubtedly a need for further empirical testing with larger sample sizes\n            to further address the question of what respondents consider when answering preference\n            elicitation questions and how this influences their valuations. More investigation\n            is needed into the role of income effects in generic instruments such as the one already\n            used, the EQ\u20105D, but also others such as the SF\u20106D and the HUI. The HUI would be particularly\n            interesting as it already specifically rules out the consideration of income effects.\n            The effects of explicit instruction also need to be investigated further. While it\n            may be useful to enhance the consistency of the inclusion or exclusion of certain\n            effects by explicit instruction, it may have unintended side effects as well. Explicit\n            instruction to ignore certain, previously unmentioned, items from the valuation process\n            may result in the opposite if people find it difficult to explicitly exclude items.\n            Moreover, an explicit instruction to include certain aspects may lead them to receive\n            too much weight in the subsequent valuation procedure. Therefore, if further evidence\n            shows that explicit instruction makes no difference, then the exclusion of productivity\n            costs in HSVs and thus from the numerator of the C/E ratio, might not even need to\n            be explicit. More research is needed in a wider selection of countries since results\n            are likely to be very sensitive to the local social security system.\nSome of the studies have not only looked at income effects but at leisure effects\n            related to ill health as well (since impaired health may affect the utility derived\n            from leisure time). It seems important to continue to do so in future studies, not\n            only to find out whether leisure is currently adequately valued in terms of QoL\n39\nbut in addition to disentangle leisure and income effects in empirical studies.\nFinally, improved understanding may be gained through separation of the income and\n            real health effects, e.g., by valuing just health through a TTO exercise (with explicit\n            exclusion of income effects) and then valuing only income through a TTO exercise.\n            It would be interesting to see if the relationship between income and health proves\n            to be additive or if there is some, more complex, interaction between the two.\nIn conclusion, it is far from clear whether income effects are in or out of HSVs and\n            how this affects subsequent valuations. New studies with an adequate sample size are\n            needed, preferably using representative samples of the general population in some\n            jurisdiction. The use of generic health states seems to be most informative (since\n            economic evaluations are now typically informed by population value sets), such as\n            EQ\u20105D states. Given important differences between countries in terms of social security\n            systems etc, consideration should be given to the generalizability of results to other\n            countries. Given the serious doubts regarding the accuracy of valuing productivity\n            losses through QoL, monetary methods to include productivity costs seem preferable.\n            Whether this requires explicit instructions in order to avoid double\u2010counting needs\n            further investigation. Until more conclusive evidence is available in this area, economic\n            evaluators seeking to include productivity costs may wish to present results from\n            both the numerator and denominator methods as a sensitivity analysis. They may also\n            consider presenting results with productivity costs excluded altogether. This would\n            highlight the influence on results, facilitate comparisons between jurisdictions that\n            do and do not take a societal perspective, and help avoid double\u2010counting. While it\n            is too early to make a final statement on the question whether income is in or out\n            of HSVs, the evidence so far largely suggests that in terms of a reliable and substantial\n            impact on QoL it is out.\nSource of financial support: None.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

Operations managers have difficulty assessing\n         the impact of TQEM programs because of the lack of appropriate measures. In order\n         for TQEM to be given serious consideration, a cost framework is required for evaluating\n         TQEM by appropriately including all the environmental costs and savings for each investment\n         option.

We wanted to evaluate how adjustment for potential confounders\n         affected the relationship between HRQoL and asthma. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate\n         the relationship of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) with HRQoL.\nMethods:\nWe carried out a cross\u2010sectional Norwegian community study in 1996/1997 including\n         2306 randomly selected subjects aged 26 years\u201381 years. Data on HRQoL were measured\n         by SF\u201012.

The correlations between these QOL questionnaires and various clinical\n         parameters were then examined. The responses of 31 elderly COPD patients to the QOL\n         scale and the SGRQ before and 3 months after the completion of a comprehensive pulmonary\n         rehabilitation program were compared longitudinally.\nRESULTS:\nOn cross\u2010sectional study, the QOL scale showed a significant correlation with the\n         total score and three components of the SGRQ. The QOL scale correlated significantly\n         with all components of the SF\u201036, but the total SGRQ score correlated with only six\n         components of the SF\u201036, excluding vitality and the mental health index. Both the\n         QOL scale and the total score of the SGRQ correlated significantly with the oxygen\n         cost diagram (OCD), Morale scale, 6\u2010minute walking distance (6MWD), forced expiratory\n         volume in 1 second, and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) score. When\n         subjects were divided into three groups according to disease severity (mild, moderate,\n         severe) using American Thoracic Society guidelines, the total SGRQ score discriminated\n         between the three groups. The QOL scale could not discriminate between mild and moderate\n         or moderate and severe. On longitudinal study, 3 months after finishing the comprehensive\n         pulmonary rehabilitation program, the QOL scale, the SGRQ, 6MWD, and OCD all showed\n         significant improvement. The difference in the QOL scale after the comprehensive pulmonary\n         rehabilitation program showed a significant correlation with changes in the SGRQ total\n         score and the OCD but not with the 6MWD.\nCONCLUSION:\nThe QOL scale is similar to more\u2010complex questionnaires such as the SGRQ in terms\n         of validity and responsiveness for evaluating disease\u2010specific HRQoL in elderly COPD\n         patients.

The benefits of rehabilitation include a decrease in dyspnoea\n            and fatigue, and improvements in exercise tolerance and health\u2010related quality of\n            life. Importantly, rehabilitation reduces hospitalization for acute exacerbations\n            and is cost\u2010effective.

The problems commonly encountered in pulmonary rehabilitation,\n            together with recommendations to avoid these problems and strategies to assist in\n            their resolution, are discussed. The review concludes with recommendations for evaluating\n            a PRP.\nINTRODUCTION\nPulmonary rehabilitation is an evidence\u2010based, multidisciplinary and comprehensive\n            intervention for patients with chronic lung disease who are symptomatic, and often\n            have decreased daily life activities.\n1\nThe aims of pulmonary rehabilitation are to reduce the symptoms and disability for\n            people with lung disease with the overall goal of optimizing their functional status.\nPulmonary rehabilitation plays an essential role in the management of individuals\n            with COPD.\n2\n-\n7\nWorldwide, COPD is a common and costly disease, and the burden associated with this\n            disease is projected to rise as a result of the ageing population.\n8\n,\n9\nThe evidence for rehabilitation in patients with COPD is compelling.\n10\nThe benefits include a decrease in symptoms (dyspnoea and fatigue) and improvements\n            in exercise tolerance and health\u2010related quality of life (HRQoL).\n10\n,\n11\nThese benefits have been shown in patients with stable disease and in those recovering\n            from an acute exacerbation.\n10\n,\n12\n,\n13\nImportantly, in patients with COPD, rehabilitation reduces hospitalization for an\n            exacerbation and is cost\u2010effective.\n14\nA comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) includes patient assessment,\n            exercise training, education, nutritional intervention and psychosocial support.\n1\nExercise training is the component with the strongest level of evidence for benefit;\n10\ntherefore, where resources are scarce, priority should be directed towards offering\n            a program of supervised exercise training.\nAlthough individuals with COPD constitute over 80% of the patients in PRP in Western\n            countries,\n15\n-\n17\nthere is evidence that rehabilitation benefits patients with restrictive impairments\n            (interstitial lung disease (ILD), chest wall and neuromuscular disease),\n18\n-\n25\nbronchiectasis,\n26\n,\n27\nasthma\n28\n-\n30\nand individuals undergoing lung resection\n31\n-\n33\nand these conditions are the focus of this review.\nThis review describes the processes for establishing, delivering and evaluating a\n            PRP but is not intended to provide a comprehensive summary of the pulmonary rehabilitation\n            literature as this is available elsewhere.\n1\n,\n10\n,\n34\nThroughout the review we have specified the minimum requirements for a PRP to facilitate\n            the establishment of these programs using limited resources.\nESTABLISHING A PULMONARY REHABILITATION PROGRAM\nFunding and promotion\nWhere possible, dedicated funding should be sought to establish a PRP.\nEstimates of the cost of running a PRP have been reported,\n35\n-\n37\nand the cost\u2010effectiveness of a PRP over standard care has been established.\n14\nThese costing estimates vary depending upon the health\u2010care system, existing infrastructure\n               and equipment, staffing and duration of the program. Low cost programs in existing\n               facilities have been shown to be effective.\n37\n,\n38\nLack of resources ought not to deter clinicians from seeking to establish a PRP.\n               It is possible that funds used to provide existing services that lack a strong evidence\n               base could be reallocated to the establishment of a PRP.\nThe process of establishing and maintaining a PRP is contingent on key stakeholders\n               (funding providers, referrers and program participants) being informed and regularly\n               reminded of the benefits of such programs. Coordinators of PRP are recommended to\n               maintain a high profile with their stakeholders and provide them with evidence from\n               published studies that programs result in cost savings,\n14\n,\n36\n,\n37\n,\n39\n,\n40\nas well as any evidence that their program decreases health\u2010care utilization. Referrers\n               who are regularly informed of the benefits of rehabilitation are more likely to advocate\n               for the existence of programs.\nStaffing\nCurrent position statements recommend that a comprehensive PRP utilizes a multidisciplinary\n               approach.\n1\n,\n10\n,\n41\nTable\u20031\nlists the health professionals and their potential contributions in the provision\n               of pulmonary rehabilitation. Models of service provision vary both between and within\n               countries. Availability of staff and resources will ultimately determine the model\n               of service provided.\nTable 1.\nHealth\u2010care professionals and their potential roles in pulmonary rehabilitation\nTeam member\nRole\nRespiratory physician\nMedical assessment and pharmacological management\nReferral/screening for PRP\nOxygen prescription\nPhysiotherapist\n\u2020\nExercise testing, prescription and training\nMusculoskeletal assessment, treatment and advice\nAirway clearance education\nStrategies for the management of dyspnoea\nInspiratory muscle training\nAssessment of ambulatory oxygen requirements\nRespiratory nurse\nDisease\u2010specific education\nDevelopment of action plans\nHome visiting and support\nDietitian\nNutritional assessment and advice\nOccupational therapist\nAssessment and modification of home environment\nPharmacist\nAdvice/education on respiratory medication and inhaler use\nSocial worker\nInformation and access to support services\nPsychologist\nPsychosocial assessment and treatment for conditions such as anxiety, panic and depression\n\u2020\nIn some countries some of these roles may be fulfilled by a physical therapist, respiratory\n                        therapist or exercise physiologist.\nPRP, pulmonary rehabilitation program.\nThe minimum staffing requirement for a PRP is a referrer and a health\u2010care professional\n               to supervise exercise testing and training, one of whom may also assume the role of\n               program coordinator.\nProgram referrer\nPatients should be referred to a PRP by a respiratory or general physician who is\n                  available to the staff providing the program to discuss any medical problems that\n                  arise during rehabilitation and oxygen prescription.\nProgram coordinator\nThere is no clear evidence to recommend a specific discipline of health\u2010care professional\n                  to coordinate a PRP. A dedicated program coordinator is required to: process referrals;\n                  make appointments for assessments; allocate individuals to exercise classes; produce\n                  written materials; facilitate input from the multidisciplinary team; communicate with\n                  the referrers; and organize maintenance options for patients upon completion of the\n                  program. The program coordinator should be a health\u2010care professional with an interest\n                  and knowledge of chronic lung diseases such as a specialist nurse or other health\u2010care\n                  worker. However, if the program coordinator is also responsible for prescribing and\n                  supervising the exercise training component of the program, a physiotherapist is most\n                  appropriate for the role. The program coordinator should contribute to patient assessment\n                  as well as the education and self\u2010management sessions. Given the complexity and needs\n                  of patients referred to a PRP, a dedicated senior health\u2010care professional is best\n                  suited to the role of program coordinator. Providing one person \u2018ownership\u2019 of the\n                  PRP is more likely to encourage them to promote the program and modify its content\n                  in accordance with the latest research.\nExercise testing and training\nThe individual responsible for supervising exercise testing and training should be\n                  a health\u2010care professional with knowledge of chronic lung diseases, expertise in exercise\n                  testing, prescription and training, and competent in cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n                  (CPR).\n42\nReports of staff\u2010to\u2010patient ratio for exercise training in PRP range from 1:4\n43\nto 1:8.\n44\nPatient safety and disease severity are the most important factors to consider when\n                  determining this ratio. It is recommended that a single staff member supervises a\n                  maximum of 8\u201310 patients training in one class.\n37\nIn block programs (i.e. where a group of patients start and finish a program together),\n                  a higher staff\u2010to\u2010patient ratio is desirable at the start of the program when all\n                  patients are unfamiliar with their exercise program. In some settings, specific medico\u2010legal\n                  requirements may dictate the staff\u2010to\u2010patient ratio for supervised exercise training.\nFacility and equipment\nThe essential requirements comprise a space for patient assessments that includes\n               a level corridor or walking track suitable to carryout a field walking test. For exercise\n               training, an area is needed such as a gym or large room, and an indoor or outdoor\n               track for walking training.\nTable\u20032\nlists the equipment required for a PRP. Programs in existing facilities may have\n               access to shared equipment.\nTable 2.\nEquipment required for a pulmonary rehabilitation program\nMinimum requirement\nOptional\nPulse oximeter\nWeights machine/multigym\nPolar heart rate monitor\nStationary cycle\nSphygmomanometer\nSpirometer\nOdometer (for walking test/track)\nGlucometer\nStopwatch\nInspiratory muscle training device\nWalking track/treadmill\nRollator\nHand weights\nStairs/step\nPortable oxygen and nasal prongs\nEmergency equipment and response\nA first aid kit with a CPR mask, gloves and rescue medications (inhaled short\u2010acting\n               bronchodilator and spacer, glucose replacement, glyceryl trinitrate spray) is recommended.\n44\nEmergency response in the community setting may comprise phone access to call an\n               ambulance. In hospital settings, staff must be familiar with the emergency response\n               protocol.\nLocation of program\nPulmonary rehabilitation programs are most commonly provided within a hospital outpatient\n               department or community health facility. These centre\u2010based programs enable existing\n               infrastructure to be used and often permit access to a range of health professionals.\n               In the hospital setting, immediate medical support is available making this the most\n               appropriate setting for patients with very severe disease and complex comorbidities,\n               in particular those with significant cardiovascular disease. Patients with mild to\n               moderate respiratory disease and no serious comorbidities can be managed in a community\u2010based\n               PRP.\nDepending on the available resources, either a block program, where a group of patients\n               start and finish a program together, or a continuous rolling program in which patients\n               enter and exit a program at different times, can be provided. The group setting provides\n               patients with the opportunity to observe others with lung disease performing exercise\n               and this may provide reassurance, motivation and psychosocial support.\nOther locations for PRP include within the patient's home\n45\n,\n46\nand at physiotherapy practices.\n28\n,\n47\nThere is also evidence of benefit from inpatient programs for patients with stable\n               lung disease\n48\nand although these are costly, they provide an option for patients who live in remote\n               areas without access to a local program. Home\u2010based programs are convenient for the\n               patient and may allow easier integration of exercise and physical activity into daily\n               life.\n49\nHowever, regular visits by staff to supervise exercise training is resource intensive\n               and patients lack the benefits gained from peer support. Access to a range of health\n               professionals is also usually limited. Regular telephone calls may provide an alternative\n               method for monitoring and progressing exercise although many patients with severe\n               dyspnoea require direct observation in order to feel confident when exercising and\n               for the progression of exercises to occur.\nTelerehabilitation is an emerging method of delivering rehabilitation services to\n               patients in remote settings and may be an option for patients who are unable to leave\n               their home.\n50\nHowever, as most of the evidence for pulmonary rehabilitation has been derived from\n               programs offered within hospital outpatient departments,\n10\n,\n11\nwhere possible, we recommend that options are sought to enable patients to travel\n               to a centre\u2010based program.\nDELIVERING A PULMONARY REHABILITATION PROGRAM\nPatient selection\nAny person with chronic lung disease who, despite optimal medical management, is limited\n               by breathlessness on physical activity should be considered for pulmonary rehabilitation.\n               Current smokers should not be excluded from PRP. Individuals with pre\u2010existing comorbidities\n               that compromise their safe participation in exercise training (e.g. severe neurological\n               dysfunction, unstable cardiovascular disease, recent exertional syncope, severe cognitive\n               impairment) and those who are not motivated to attend a program are unlikely to benefit\n               and should not be referred.\nDo all patients with COPD benefit from rehabilitation?\nImprovements following rehabilitation have been shown in patients with COPD irrespective\n               of the severity of their disease (i.e. %predicted FEV\n1\n),\n51\n,\n52\nor level of functional impairment (Medical Research Council Grade).\n53\n-\n55\nAge and gender do not affect the outcome from a PRP.\n56\n-\n58\nOther factors that do not appear to influence the magnitude of short\u2010term improvements\n               include psychological or sociodemographic variables or current smoking status; however,\n               these may influence program adherence and completion.\n55\n,\n56\n,\n59\nThe characteristics of patients who show the greatest improvement in exercise capacity,\n               symptoms or HRQoL following rehabilitation have not been extensively studied.\n53\n,\n60\n,\n61\nFurthermore, there is a dissociation between physiologic and HRQoL improvements,\n               with some patients showing large improvements in HRQoL following rehabilitation with\n               little or no change in exercise capacity.\n60\nNo study has examined the characteristics of patients who are most likely to show\n               benefit in terms of a reduction in health\u2010care utilization. Therefore, all patients\n               with COPD who meet the referral criteria for a PRP should be offered rehabilitation.\nReferral process\nTo ensure that the resources allocated to a PRP are optimally utilized, a clear referral\n               process is required. Referral by a respiratory or general physician will ensure that\n               individuals have a medical assessment of their suitability for rehabilitation and\n               that their pharmacological management has been optimized. Endorsement of the PRP by\n               the referrer is likely to positively influence a patient's uptake of the program.\n62\nA referral form should be generated\n42\nand made readily available to the referrers.\nFigure\u20031\noutlines a suggested referral process. Written consent to participate in a PRP may\n               be a requirement in some health\u2010care systems and can be obtained at the initial assessment.\nFigure 1\nOpen in figure viewer\nPowerPoint\nReferral process.\nCaption\nReferral process.\nCommunication with the referring physician is essential for ongoing support of the\n               program. If the patient enters the program the referrer must be informed of the results\n               of the baseline and post\u2010program assessments. Furthermore, if a patient declines to\n               participate, or is deemed not suitable for the PRP, the referrer should be informed.\nPatient assessment\nUpon entry to a PRP, it is essential that all patients are interviewed regarding their\n               relevant past medical history including the presence of any conditions that might\n               affect their ability to participate in exercise training (e.g. severe lower limb arthritis)\n               or education sessions (e.g. profound hearing loss). Furthermore, adequacy of literacy\n               and vision should be ascertained as deficiencies in these areas will reduce an individual's\n               capacity to accurately complete self\u2010report questionnaires and an exercise diary.\n               Smoking status must be recorded and, for individuals who continue to smoke, details\n               of previous attempts to quit are needed. Individuals who have recently quit smoking\n               may be at risk of relapse and may require counselling and support. Details of all\n               medications and oxygen use, including the prescribed flow rate, are necessary. Information\n               is required regarding the amount of physical activity undertaken by each patient.\n               Identification of activities that a patient is no longer able to do due to dyspnoea,\n               but would realistically like to resume on completion of a PRP, will assist with goal\n               setting, motivation and adherence. Information regarding potential barriers to program\n               attendance such as transportation difficulties or family responsibilities is important.\n               Descriptive information such as age, height, weight, FEV\n1\nand FVC, are required, and may be documented on the referral form.\nIn addition to the measurements to be made before and after a PRP outlined in\nTable\u20033\n, information related to health\u2010care utilization, particularly the number of hospital\n               admissions and length of stay in the 12\u2003months before and following the PRP, is needed\n               to evaluate the potential cost savings attributable to the program. Measurements of\n               peripheral muscle strength assist in determining the effects of resistance training.\n               However, obtaining repeatable measurements with the sensitivity to detect a change\n               in strength in an individual patient requires complex equipment that is expensive\n               and beyond the scope of most clinical programs.\n84\n,\n85\nAlthough measures are available to assess upper limb function\n86\n-\n88\nand balance,\n89\n-\n91\nthey are not essential.\nTable 3.\nTests and measurements recommended for patient assessment\nTest or measurement\nComments\nExercise capacity\nField\u2010based walking test\n\u2020\nThe three tests most commonly used are: (i) six\u2010minute walk test (6MWT);\n63\n(ii) incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT);\n64\nand (iii) endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT).\n65\nAt least one of these tests is necessary to evaluate the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation\n                              on functional exercise capacity. To account for the known learning effect, measures\n                              recorded before a PRP should be the best of two tests.\n66\n,\n67\nTwo 6MWTs do not appear to be required at post\u2010program assessment.\n68\n6MWT and ISWT can be used to prescribe initial training intensity.\nMID\n6MWT: ranges from 25 to 54\u2003m,\n69\n-\n71\napproximately 10% of the 6MWD measured before commencing the PRP.\nISWT: approximately 48\u2003m.\n72\nESWT: unknown.\nCardiopulmonary exercise test\nMay be incremental or constant power test, performed on a cycle ergometer or a treadmill.\n73\nMID\nCycling: exercise time at 75% of peak power during a constant power test: 101s or\n                              34% of the time at baseline assessment.\n74\nTreadmill: unknown.\nHealth\u2010related quality of life\n\u2020\nChronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRDQ) or Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire\n                              (SGRQ)\nCRDQ comprises four domains; dyspnoea, fatigue, emotional function and mastery.\n75\nSGRQ comprises three subscales; symptoms, impact and activity.\n76\nAt least one of these HRQoL questionnaires is required.\nCRDQ is more responsive to short\u2010term changes following a PRP than the SGRQ.\n77\nMID\nCRDQ: 0.5 points per item or 10 points for total score.\n78\nSGRQ: 4 points.\n79\nSymptoms and mood\nMedical Research Council Scale\n\u2020\nMeasures functional limitation resulting from dyspnoea on a scale of 1 to 5.\n80\nMore useful to discriminate between patients than to evaluate effects of a PRP.\nMMRC uses a scale that ranges from 0 to 4.\nHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\nUsed to screen for feelings of anxiety and depression.\n81\nScore\u2003\u2265\u200311 on the depression or anxiety subscale suggests depression or anxiety is\n                              present.\n81\nAssessment of anxiety and depression is essential when there is access to a mental\n                              health\u2010care professional.\nMID\nAnxiety and depression subscale: approximately 1.5 points.\n82\nComposite measures\nBODE Index\nAggregate score, which comprises measures of BMI, FEV\n1\n, functional limitation resulting from dyspnoea (MMRC Scale) and 6MWD.\n83\nThe BODE index is a strong predictor of survival.\n83\n\u2020\nIndicates that the assessment is essential.\nHRQoL, health\u2010related quality of life; MID, minimal important difference in patients\n                        with COPD; MMRC, Modified Medical Research Council; PRP, pulmonary rehabilitation\n                        program.\nOn completion of the PRP, patients should be asked to reflect on their achievements\n               and the effect the program has had on symptoms such as dyspnoea, and their daily physical\n               activity. A discussion of strategies to maintain the training\u2010related gains such as\n               adherence to a home exercise program and enrolment in a maintenance PRP is essential.\n               Assessments performed at regular intervals following completion of an initial PRP\n               will assist in determining the extent to which rehabilitation\u2010related gains have been\n               maintained. It is recommended to allow 60\u201390\u2003min for the initial assessment and 30\u201345\u2003min\n               for assessments undertaken on completion of a PRP.\nExercise training\nProgram duration and frequency of training\nAlthough there is no consensus of opinion regarding the optimal duration of an initial\n                  PRP, it appears that a minimum of 20 sessions is needed to achieve physiologic benefits.\n1\n,\n10\nMost programs are between 6 and 9\u2003weeks in duration.\n15\n-\n17\nThe recommended frequency of training for endurance exercise is at least three times\n                  a week of which a minimum of two sessions should be supervised.\n1\nWe recommend two supervised sessions each week and encouraging patients to exercise\n                  unsupervised at home on an additional 2 or 3\u2003days.\n37\nSupervision of training is essential to ensure that training intensity is progressed.\n                  Supervision also allows staff to provide motivation, reassurance and encouragement.\n                  Longer programs that include a greater number of supervised sessions may produce greater\n                  improvements in exercise tolerance, and be more effective at achieving the behavioural\n                  change needed to optimize the longevity of training\u2010related improvements.\n10\n,\n34\nHowever, it is less clear that outcomes such as dyspnoea and HRQoL are influenced\n                  by program duration.\n92\n-\n94\nLonger programs may increase waiting periods to access a program.\nLower limb endurance training\nAs patients with lung disease commonly avoid walking due to breathlessness and fatigue,\n                  training the muscles of ambulation is a mandatory component of a PRP.\n10\nWalking that is either ground\u2010based or utilizes a treadmill is an essential component\n                  of an exercise program as walking is an important activity in daily life. Training\n                  using a cycle ergometer is also beneficial as this modality imposes a greater specific\n                  load on the quadriceps muscles than walking.\n95\nHowever, supervised ground\u2010based walking training results in a significantly greater\n                  increase in walking endurance capacity compared with supervised cycle\u2010based training.\n96\nAlthough training at a relatively high intensity (>60% maximal work rate) is needed\n                  to achieve a physiologic training benefit,\n97\nnot all patients can tolerate this intensity. Improvements in symptoms, HRQoL and\n                  ability to perform some activities of daily living have been shown following training\n                  at lower intensities.\n98\n-\n100\nThe intensity for walking training should be based on a field walking test (best of\n                  two tests) performed at the baseline assessment. For ground\u2010based walking, most patients\n                  can tolerate an intensity equivalent to 80% of the average speed achieved on the six\u2010minute\n                  walk test (6MWT), or 75% of the peak speed or 85% of the estimated peak rate of oxygen\n                  consumption derived from the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT).\n42\n,\n54\n,\n101\n-\n103\nThe prescribed intensity (walking speed) may need to be reduced by 0.5 to 1\u2003kph at\n                  the commencement of training if a treadmill is used due to the unfamiliarity of walking\n                  on this equipment.\n42\n,\n102\nThe recommended starting intensity for cycle ergometry training is >60% of the peak\n                  power measured on an incremental cycle ergometry test (where this is available), or\n                  determined using equations that estimate peak power based on the distance walked on\n                  the 6MWT or ISWT.\n104\n-\n108\nAfter the initial prescription, the intensity for walking and cycling should be adjusted\n                  based on patient tolerance with the aim of achieving a dyspnoea score of 3\u20135 (moderate\n                  to severe) or Rating of Perceived Exertion of 12\u201314 (somewhat hard).\n109\n,\n110\nThe recommended duration for lower limb endurance training is at least 30\u2003min (exclusive\n                  of rests).\n10\nWhen patients are unable to achieve continuous walking or cycling for 30\u2003min at the\n                  prescribed intensity due to intolerable symptoms, frequent rests should be encouraged\n                  or interval training used.\n111\nVery debilitated patients may only tolerate lower limb endurance training for 15\u201320\u2003min\n                  at the start of a program.\nTable\u20034\nsummarizes the principles of prescription for lower limb endurance training in PRP.\n                  More details can be found elsewhere.\n42\nTable 4.\nRecommendations for lower limb endurance training\nPrescription for physiologic benefits\nMode\nWalking, cycling\nFrequency per week\nTwo supervised sessions\nEncourage patients to perform two or three unsupervised sessions\nDuration\nAt least 30\u2003min\nIntensity\n>60% maximum work rate\nProgression\nAccording to symptoms\nStrategies to optimize training load\nAchieving the training intensities required to induce a physiologic adaptation may\n                  be difficult in patients who experience marked dyspnoea on exertion. For these individuals,\n                  strategies should be considered that reduce the ventilatory (i.e. central) limitation\n                  to exercise and increase the training stimulus on the peripheral muscles, namely the\n                  quadriceps.\nThe choice of strategy is likely to be based on equipment availability, cost and familiarity\n                  of staff with the approach.\nTable\u20035\nsummarizes training strategies that can be easily implemented in clinical practice\n                  with minimal cost and equipment. Additional strategies that require specialized equipment,\n                  technical expertise and/or a high staff\u2010to\u2010patient ratio include the use of helium\n115\nor helium\u2010hyperoxia,\n116\nnon\u2010invasive positive pressure ventilation,\n117\nneuromuscular electrical stimulation,\n118\n,\n119\nventilatory feedback\n120\nand partitioning of the exercising muscle mass, such as one\u2010legged cycling.\n121\nIt is important to note that training\u2010related benefits attributable to any of these\n                  strategies will not be sustained if the strategy is not incorporated into the home\n                  exercise or maintenance programs.\nTable 5.\nStrategies available to optimize the training load that require minimal resources\nStrategy\nEvidence\nConsiderations for clinical practice\nHow does it work\nInterval training\nReduces symptoms during exercise training and improves tolerance of high\u2010intensity\n                                 exercise.\n111\nInterval\u2010training is as effective as continuous training.\n111\nInterval training involves the patient exercising using a defined work\u2003:\u2003rest ratio.\n                                 Early training sessions will require more supervision for the patient to learn the\n                                 work\u2003:\u2003rest ratio.\nProvides patients with regular breaks of either no load or a reduced load to relieve\n                                 dyspnoea or local muscle fatigue.\nRollator\nAcutely increases 6MWD and reduces dyspnoea on exertion.\n112\n,\n113\nMost likely to assist people with COPD with a low 6MWD\n112\nand/or those who needed to rest due to dyspnoea during a 6MWT.\nFixation of the upper limbs allows the accessory muscles to contribute to ventilation,\n                                 thereby reducing the work of breathing and minimizing dyspnoea.\nSupplemental oxygen\nWhen used during an exercise training program, it results in greater benefits in exercise\n                                 time during a constant load cycling test, but not performance on field\u2010based walking\n                                 tests or disease\u2010specific HRQoL.\n114\nAll patients prescribed LTOT should use supplemental oxygen during exercise. Other\n                                 patients who show profound oxygen desaturation on exertion may benefit as the oxygen\n                                 offers the opportunity to train at higher exercise intensities.\nReduces ventilatory demand at a given exercise intensity.\n6MWT, Six\u2010minute walk test; HRQoL, health\u2010related quality of life; LTOT, long\u2010term\n                           oxygen therapy.\nLower limb strength training\nIndividuals with COPD have impaired force\u2010generating capacity of their skeletal muscles.\n122\nThis weakness impacts on their capacity to undertake activities of daily living such\n                  as climbing stairs and standing up from a low chair, and contributes to exercise intolerance.\n123\nTherefore, resistance exercises are recommended to increase the strength of the lower\n                  limb muscles,\n10\nparticularly the quadriceps, and to combat the age\u2010related decline in muscle mass.\nMost resistance training programs for patients with COPD\n124\nhave been extrapolated from those recommended in healthy individuals.\n125\nStrength training should take place two or three times each week with at least one\n                  day of rest between sessions. Functional exercises that strengthen the lower limbs\n                  (e.g. sit\u2010to\u2010stand, step\u2010ups and wall squats) are recommended for PRP with limited\n                  equipment and also because they can be undertaken easily in the home. Training should\n                  commence by performing one set of 8\u201312 repetitions of each exercise and progressed\n                  by increasing the number of sets from one to three,\n126\nand thereafter increasing the load using hand weights. Muscle loading may be achieved\n                  using a multigym if available. It is important to warn patients regarding delayed\n                  onset muscle soreness.\nStrength training represents an adjunct to, not a replacement for, endurance training.\n                  However, in individuals who are very deconditioned (e.g. following prolonged hospitalization\n                  for an acute exacerbation) or with marked dyspnoea on minimal exertion, it may be\n                  appropriate to allocate more time to resistance exercises as they are associated with\n                  less ventilatory load\n127\nand cause less dyspnoea, and may be better tolerated than endurance exercises.\nUpper limb training (endurance and strength)\nMany patients with moderate to severe COPD report dyspnoea during activities that\n                  involve using their arms such as showering, dressing and carrying groceries. Therefore,\n                  it is important that arm exercises are included in the training program\n10\nto improve arm exercise capacity.\n128\nBoth endurance and resistance exercises should be prescribed. It is important that\n                  overhead arm exercises are progressed carefully and the health\u2010care professional responsible\n                  for supervising the exercise program monitors individuals closely for symptoms of\n                  shoulder and neck pain.\nUnsupported endurance arm exercises (e.g. arm raises) are preferable to supported\n                  arm exercise (e.g. arm cycle ergometry).\n129\nAsking the patient to lift their arms alternately overhead 15 times holding a light\n                  weight (e.g. 1\u20132\u2003kg) is an example of a simple unsupported endurance arm exercise.\n                  As with lower limb endurance exercise, progression of exercise intensity should be\n                  titrated according to symptoms of dyspnoea and local muscle fatigue.\n130\nResistance exercises are needed to strengthen the shoulder and arm muscles and can\n                  be performed using free weights or a multigym if available. In contrast with endurance\n                  exercise, resistance exercises are characterized by higher weights and lower repetitions.\n126\nThe principles of prescription and progression described for lower limb strength\n                  training can be applied for upper limb strength training.\nOther strategies to manage dyspnoea during exercise: pursed lips breathing, exhalation\n                  on effort and forward\u2010lean position\nThe evidence to support breathing exercises in people with chronic lung disease is\n                  limited.\n131\n,\n132\nHowever, some patients with moderate to severe COPD may derive benefit from breathing\n                  strategies and those who gain benefit should be encouraged to use them to minimize\n                  dyspnoea and be provided with a simple explanation why they are beneficial.\nPursed lips breathing is spontaneously adopted by some patients with COPD during exertion\n                  and when recovering from activity. The technique aims to prevent airway closure. Pursed\n                  lips breathing reduces respiratory rate by prolonging expiratory time in patients\n                  with COPD.\n133\n-\n135\nPatients who are most likely to benefit tend to adopt the technique spontaneously.\n136\n-\n138\nSome patients breath\u2010hold during specific activities and this exacerbates dyspnoea\n                  and reduces their ability to continue the activity. Instructing patients to exhale,\n                  for example when bending down or when standing up from a chair, may be a useful strategy\n                  to avoid breath\u2010holding.\n131\nAlthough there is little evidence to support the use of techniques such as breathing\n                  control some patients find it useful during periods of acute dyspnoea.\n131\n,\n132\nDeep breathing exercises and thoracic expansion exercises are not strategies for\n                  dyspnoea management and therefore are not indicated for this purpose. The role of\n                  these exercises is to assist with airway clearance, where indicated.\nThe forward\u2010lean position, especially if this is combined with fixation of the shoulder\n                  girdle, often provides some relief from dyspnoea. This position optimizes recruitment\n                  of the accessory muscles of respiration and improves the mechanical advantage of the\n                  diaphragm.\n139\n-\n141\nIndividuals with COPD often adopt this position when recovering from bouts of physical\n                  activity. When walking, fixation of the shoulder girdle is achieved by placing hands\n                  on hips, placing hands or thumbs in pockets, or by use of a rollator.\nFlexibility and stretching exercises\nThese exercises aim to increase muscle length and joint range of movement, and to\n                  prevent the risk of exercise\u2010related injury and delayed onset muscle soreness.\n142\nHowever, the exercise intensity that patients with moderate to severe respiratory\n                  disease can achieve will be constrained by their ventilatory limitations and hence\n                  the risk of exercise\u2010related injury is likely to be considerably lower than in a healthy\n                  population.\nThese exercises should be carried out for a maximum of 5\u201310\u2003min within each exercise\n                  class as the focus of training must be on exercises to improve endurance and strength.\n1\n,\n10\n,\n34\nFlexibility exercises, such as rotation of the thoracic spine, may help to maintain\n                  thoracic mobility. Stretching exercises should focus on lengthening the accessory\n                  muscles of respiration such as the pectoral muscles, which may be shortened due to\n                  the prolonged use of a forward\u2010lean position to alleviate breathlessness. Lower limb\n                  stretches, for example of the calf or quadriceps muscles, are only indicated for individuals\n                  considered to be at risk of injury or muscle soreness.\nInspiratory muscle training\nInspiratory muscle training (IMT) is not recommended as a routine component of a PRP,\n10\nas the addition of IMT to a program of whole body exercise training does not confer\n                  additional benefits in exercise capacity, dyspnoea or HRQoL.\n143\nHowever, as IMT performed in isolation reduces dyspnoea and confers small gains in\n                  exercise capacity and HRQoL,\n144\n,\n145\nit should be considered for individuals who are unable to participate in whole body\n                  exercise training due to comorbidites such as severe musculoskeletal pain. Threshold\n                  loading devices are recommended for IMT as the training load imposed is largely independent\n                  of the patient's breathing pattern.\n146\nLoads \u226530% of an individual's maximum inspiratory pressure are needed to confer benefit,\n147\nand an interval\u2010based training approach, where work periods are interspersed with\n                  regular rest periods, is recommended to optimize the load that can be tolerated.\n148\n,\n149\nSafety during exercise\nIt is important to note that both exercise testing and training are generally considered\n                  safe for individuals with chronic lung disease. Specifically, in a study of more than\n                  600 patients referred to a PRP who underwent a 6MWT before exercise training, adverse\n                  events were observed during 28 (5%) tests, of which the most common event (20 tests)\n                  was profound transient oxygen desaturation (oxygen saturation [SpO\n2\n]<80%).\n150\nFurthermore, although dozens of studies have investigated exercise training in patients\n                  with symptomatic lung disease, to our knowledge no serious adverse events, such as\n                  myocardial infarction or death, have been documented during a supervised exercise\n                  class. Nevertheless, it is prudent that patients are screened and monitored to identify\n                  abnormal responses during exercise testing and training.\nPatients must be screened for the presence of comorbidities that may compromise their\n                  safety during exercise, such as symptomatic ischaemic heart disease, by both the referrer\n                  and the health\u2010care professional responsible for supervising the training. Measurements\n                  of heart rate, SpO\n2\nand dyspnoea at rest are needed before commencing an exercise test or training session.\n                  Delaying exercise testing and training should be considered for individuals with an\n                  abnormal resting heart rate (i.e. <50 or \u2265125\u2003bpm), SpO\n2\n<90% or excessive dyspnoea (scores on the Borg scale\u2003\u2265\u20034). Exercise must be stopped\n                  immediately for any individual who develops chest pain, evidence of a new cardiac\n                  arrhythmia, dizziness or nausea. Monitoring of heart rate and SpO\n2\nis necessary throughout an exercise test. During supervised training, SpO\n2\nand heart rate should be measured upon completion of walking training and after cycling\n                  and step\u2010ups in those patients who show significant desaturation when walking. Consideration\n                  should be given to terminating an exercise test or asking individuals to rest during\n                  training if they show: (i) an increase in their heart rate such that it approaches\n                  their age predicted maximum; (ii) a decrease in SpO\n2\nto \u226485%; or (iii) marked wheeze. Profound desaturation is more likely to occur during\n                  walking compared with cycling exercise in patients with COPD.\n151\n-\n153\nPatients ought to be instructed to bring any prescribed short\u2010acting bronchodilators\n                  or vasodilators (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate) to every exercise testing or training session.\n                  Furthermore, individuals with diabetes should be instructed to bring along glucose\n                  supplements to independently manage any hypoglycaemic episodes.\nImpact of comorbidities on exercise training\nPatients referred to PRP often have one or more comorbidities\n154\nthat may impact on their ability to exercise.\nMusculoskeletal problems.\nOsteoporosis and arthrosis are present in many patients referred to PRP.\n154\n,\n155\nLand\u2010based exercise may exacerbate pain associated with these conditions. A history\n                     of any musculoskeletal problems should be documented at assessment and care taken\n                     when prescribing exercises. The initial prescription requires modification to address\n                     these problems and progression of exercises should only occur after the patient has\n                     completed at least two supervised sessions without any increase in pain. The use of\n                     appropriate footwear is essential for walking training. It is possible that water\u2010based\n                     exercise may be more effective for individuals who are severely limited by musculoskeletal\n                     pain. Physical training in water is feasible and effective in patients with COPD.\n156\n,\n157\nBody composition abnormalities.\nSome patients with COPD referred to PRP have abnormalities in body composition. Patients\n                     may be underweight (with depleted fat free mass)\n158\nor overweight/obese.\n159\nThese conditions may necessitate modification of the exercise training program. The\n                     underweight patient will require nutritional advice (with possible caloric supplementation)\n                     to ensure that the extra physical activity does not lead to further weight loss. For\n                     the overweight or obese patient, it may be difficult to participate in exercise training\n                     due to concurrent lower limb musculoskeletal problems and specialized exercise equipment\n                     may be required. Nutritional advice for weight loss is necessary during the training\n                     program as exercise alone is unlikely to significantly reduce body weight.\nPeripheral arterial disease.\nIntermittent claudication may be the symptom that limits walking in some patients\n                     who participate in a PRP. To gain optimal improvements in their claudication symptoms\n                     these patients should be encouraged to walk beyond the onset of pain for as long as\n                     they can tolerate. The recommended duration and frequency of walking training is at\n                     least 30\u2003min and 3\u2003days per week, respectively.\n160\n,\n161\nExercise training for patients with respiratory conditions other than COPD\nExercise training regimens for these patients have been based on protocols shown to\n               be effective in patients with COPD;\n19\n,\n20\n,\n26\n,\n27\n,\n30\n,\n162\nhowever, some modifications are required to ensure the safety and suitability of\n               the exercise prescription. Furthermore, the content of the education component within\n               the PRP requires adaptation.\nInterstitial lung disease\nInterstitial lung disease comprises a heterogeneous group of conditions with variable\n                  prognosis. In addition to exertional dyspnoea and fatigue, a non\u2010productive cough\n                  can be troublesome during exercise especially in patients with IPF.\n25\n,\n163\nOxygen requirements are variable among patients with ILD with some patients maintaining\n                  acceptable oxygen saturation at rest but displaying rapid and profound desaturation\n                  during exercise despite the use of interval training. Desaturation is especially likely\n                  to occur when exercise involves large muscle groups, in particular walking\n108\nand is often observed in the absence of significant dyspnoea. Some patients with\n                  very severe disease are likely to require high flow supplementary oxygen; these patients\n                  should be managed within a hospital\u2010based PRP.\nNon\u2010cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis\nExercise training in this patient population may have the additional benefit of enhancing\n                  airway clearance. In the group setting, patients should be encouraged to huff to clear\n                  secretions and it is important that the health\u2010care professional responsible for supervising\n                  the class informs other patients that cough and expectoration are normal occurrences\n                  during exercise in people with bronchiectasis.\nAsthma\nIn some individuals it can be difficult to distinguish between asthma and COPD as\n                  these two conditions may coexist.\n2\nLong\u2010standing asthma on its own can lead to fixed airflow obstruction.\n164\nWhen optimally managed, many individuals with asthma can tolerate high\u2010intensity\n                  training and can be appropriately managed in community\u2010based programs. Oxygen desaturation\n                  during exercise is uncommon in people with asthma.\n30\n,\n165\nThe use of inhaled bronchodilators before exercise, a warm\u2010up period of low intensity\n                  exercise and the use of interval training are recommended to reduce symptoms during\n                  exercise.\n166\n,\n167\nPatients with asthma may be very sensitive to odours, for example from perfume or\n                  cologne, therefore in the class setting all patients should be instructed to avoid\n                  using these products.\nSurgical lung resection\nIndividuals who report dyspnoea on exertion or reduced exercise tolerance before or\n                  after surgical resection for lung cancer should be referred to a PRP. Preliminary\n                  data suggest that supervised exercise training improves exercise capacity and HRQoL\n                  in these individuals.\n31\n-\n33\nSpecial considerations in this patient population relate to timing of rehabilitation\n                  following surgical resection, the management of postoperative pain and the impact\n                  concurrent therapy (i.e. chemotherapy or radiotherapy) may have on program attendance.\n                  Although a graduated walking program is recommended in the immediate postoperative\n                  period, participation in an outpatient PRP should be considered when the wound has\n                  healed and medical clearance has been obtained to exercise (usually about 30\u2003days\n                  postoperatively). Arm exercises are necessary to improve shoulder range of movement\n                  and the strength of muscles affected by the surgery. These exercises may need to be\n                  modified to minimize discomfort with overhead activities. Patients who experience\n                  difficulty attending exercise classes due to radiation or chemotherapy treatments\n                  should be offered a longer program.\nMaintenance of benefits from exercise training\nTransferring exercise into the home setting\nImplementation of a home exercise program during a PRP has two purposes. First, it\n                  will optimize the training stimulus by encouraging the patient to exercise in addition\n                  to the supervised sessions. Second, it should improve adherence to exercise training\n                  upon completion of the supervised program. For these reasons, it is essential that\n                  a home exercise program be implemented at an early stage during a PRP.\nThe home exercise program should commence after the patient has attended a minimum\n                  of two supervised sessions thereby allowing time to resolve any problems (e.g. delayed\n                  onset muscle soreness or aggravation of any pre\u2010existing musculoskeletal conditions)\n                  that may arise during training. While attending supervised sessions (minimum of two\n                  per week) we recommend an additional two or three unsupervised exercise sessions each\n                  week.\nTo assist with the uptake of exercise in the home setting, it is important for the\n                  exercises prescribed in the home program to closely resemble those undertaken in the\n                  supervised classes. Written material with descriptions and pictures of each exercise\n                  are essential within the home program. The prescription for each exercise (e.g. duration\n                  for endurance exercise, and weight and number of repetitions for resistance exercise)\n                  should be individualized based on performance during the supervised sessions. A diary\n                  is needed to monitor adherence with the home program and reviewed at regular intervals\n                  (e.g. every 2\u2003weeks) to progress the exercises in accordance with the supervised sessions.\n                  Barriers to completing the home exercise program should be discussed with the health\u2010care\n                  professional supervising the exercise classes and solutions sought during a group\n                  \u2018problem\u2010solving\u2019 activity.\nIt is essential that the home program includes information regarding when \u2018not\u2019 to\n                  exercise (e.g. when experiencing flu\u2010like symptoms, irregular heart beat or palpitations)\n                  and instructions when medical advice should be sought. Precautions for exercise must\n                  also be included, in particular for patients with asthma. These include avoiding exercise\n                  in environments with high levels of atmospheric pollution or high pollen count, and\n                  in cold and dry or windy conditions.\n166\n,\n167\nPost\u2010rehabilitation strategies\nStudies suggest that improvements in exercise capacity and health status following\n                  short\u2010term (6\u20138\u2003weeks) PRP are maintained for approximately 6\u2003months but diminish\n                  in the following 6\u201312\u2003months.\n29\n,\n168\n-\n170\nTo maintain the benefits gained following a PRP, patients need to remain physically\n                  active. Respiratory exacerbations are the most common reason reported for non\u2010adherence\n                  to home exercise programs.\n171\n,\n172\nPost\u2010rehabilitation strategies that include telephone support and regular supervised\n                  sessions,\n171\n,\n173\nand repeated PRP,\n174\nshow modest effects on long\u2010term outcomes. However, one study showed that a self\u2010selected\n                  group of patients who continued to attend a weekly maintenance exercise program, supervised\n                  by a physiotherapist, following an initial PRP adhered to their home exercise program\n                  and maintained the benefits of the initial program for up to 18\u2003months.\n172\nAnother study showed that home exercise training (with or without a weekly supervised\n                  session) combined with regular follow\u2010up testing enabled patients with moderate COPD\n                  to maintain improvements in exercise capacity and HRQoL for 12\u2003months following an\n                  initial 8\u2010week PRP.\n175\nBoth of these studies incorporated walking training, an exercise that is easily replicated\n                  in the home setting.\nTable\u20036\nsummarizes suggested maintenance strategies. Although the optimal method to facilitate\n                  adherence to a regular exercise program following completion of an initial PRP is\n                  unclear we recommend that patients are encouraged to continue their home exercise\n                  program 3\u20135 times each week.\nTable 6.\nSuggested maintenance strategies\nStrategy\nUnsupervised home exercise program with regular follow\u2010up testing (e.g. 3 or 6 monthly).\nOnce weekly supervised exercise program in low\u2010cost community setting plus home exercise\n                                 program.\nFor patients with complex comorbidities (e.g. severe cardiovascular disease), high\n                                 oxygen therapy requirements for exercise or frequent hospital admissions, a hospital\u2010based\n                                 maintenance exercise class (once per week) may be necessary.\nProvision of booster programs following an acute exacerbation.\nPatient education\nPatient education is considered to be a core component of a comprehensive PRP although\n               it is difficult to determine its benefits on health outcomes.\n1\nTraditionally, in centre\u2010based programs, information on different topics related\n               to lung disease has been presented using a lecture style format. While this didactic\n               style of education may increase knowledge\n176\nimprovements in other outcomes are minimal.\n168\n,\n177\nRecently, education within PRP has begun to focus on promoting self\u2010management skills.\n               These are the skills required by patients to monitor their condition, make appropriate\n               management decisions, interact with health professionals, adhere to recommended medical\n               regimens, and participate in activities that promote health such as physical activity,\n               regular exercise and good nutrition. It is recommended that staff that provide PRP\n               undergo training to develop the necessary skills to assist patients to achieve behavioural\n               change.\nSome facilities will not have the resources to provide group education sessions; this\n               should not be a barrier to the setting up of a PRP as the rehabilitation component\n               with the strongest level of evidence for benefit is exercise training.\n10\nThe format for the delivery of education within a PRP will vary depending on staff\n               availability and expertise. Possible options include: a formal education component\n               with members of the multidisciplinary team facilitating group sessions that are timetabled\n               to run before or after exercise classes; informal sessions integrated within the exercise\n               classes that are facilitated by the staff member responsible for supervising the class,\n               or provision of written information to patients. Education may also be delivered as\n               part of a generic or disease specific self\u2010management program.\n178\n,\n179\nTable\u20037\nlists suggestions of topics for education sessions within a PRP.\n15\n-\n17\n,\n42\nFor group sessions, the content should not be disease specific unless all participants\n               have the same respiratory diagnosis. Group sessions do not replace the need for individual\n               education. For example, nutritional advice should be given on an individual basis\n               as within a group there are likely to be both underweight and overweight patients\n               and those who have special dietary requirements.\nTable 7.\nEducation topics\nTopics suitable for group sessions\nTopics that require individual consultation\nInformation about the lungs, lung diseases and respiratory medications\n\u2020\nSmoking cessation\n\u2020\nExacerbations: prevention and management including action plans\n\u2020\nInhaler technique\n\u2020\nBenefits of physical activity and exercise\n\u2020\nNutrition\n\u2020\nCauses and management of breathlessness\n\u2020\nOxygen therapy\nCoping with chronic lung disease, management of depression, anxiety and panic attacks\n\u2020\nInstruction in airway clearance techniques\nCommunication with health professionals\n\u2020\nIssues related to travelling with lung disease\nCommunity resources including home care options\n\u2020\nSexuality issues\nContinence issues\nAdvanced care planning and end\u2010of\u2010life decision\u2010making\n\u2020\nRecommended minimum requirements.\nEducation sessions should encourage interaction among participants by incorporating\n               problem solving discussions. This provides participants with the opportunity to discuss\n               how they would apply the knowledge gained to practical situations (i.e. how to cope\n               with severe breathlessness in a public place). It is important to include goal\u2010setting,\n               decision\u2010making and individual's successes in self\u2010management within the sessions\n               to assist in improving self\u2010efficacy. Practical demonstrations and the use of diagrams,\n               models (e.g. of the lungs) and videos can be helpful. Written material is required\n               to accompany the education sessions; however, lengthy booklets with large amounts\n               of text are not appropriate. Most national lung foundations and societies are sources\n               of material for patient education.\nPatient support groups\nSupport groups for patients with chronic lung disease provide an environment for patients\n               and carers to share information, friendship, experiences and encouragement. Patients\n               can take a more active role in their health management with the advice and support\n               of others in a similar situation. These groups are either run entirely by the members\n               or facilitated by a health\u2010care professional. Following a PRP patients should be introduced\n               to existing support groups or encouraged to consider establishing a group if one does\n               not exist. Internet\u2010based support groups also exist for people with lung disease.\nTroubleshooting common problems encountered in pulmonary rehabilitation programs\nThe problems commonly encountered in pulmonary rehabilitation include: low uptake\n               of programs; poor attendance of patients in PRP; patients being re\u2010referred despite\n               completing a program (i.e. frequent flyers); and managing patients who are very anxious\n               or depressed.\nTable\u20038\nprovides recommendations to avoid these problems and strategies to assist in their\n               resolution.\nTable 8.\nTroubleshooting and recommendations\nProblem\nRecommendations\nPoor uptake of pulmonary rehabilitation\nReasons cited for non\u2010participation in a PRP include: transport difficulties; work\n                              commitments; patient considers they are too ill, will not benefit or that the program\n                              will be too difficult.\n53\n,\n59\n,\n172\nEnsure referring physician is enthusiastic about participation and advocates the importance\n                              and benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation to patients.\n62\n,\n180\nProvide clear and adequate information on the benefits of participation in simple,\n                              meaningful terms at the time of invitation. For some patients, this information is\n                              essential to overcome any anxieties associated with attending a program.\n62\nPoor attendance at programs\nLikely to result in suboptimal benefits for an individual and waste valuable health\u2010care\n                              resources\u2028Factors associated with poor attendance include: current smoking status;\n53\n,\n55\n,\n59\nlong journey to the program;\n55\nsocial isolation (e.g. living alone);\n59\nfrequent exacerbations requiring hospital admission;\n55\nsevere dyspnoea (MRC Grade 5)\n55\nand depression.\n53\nAge, gender and severity of airflow limitation (FEV\n1\n% predicted) are not predictors of attendance.\n55\n,\n59\nRespiratory and non\u2010respiratory related illness, transport issues and personal/social\n                              concerns such as family illness, are reasons reported for non\u2010completion of PRP.\n53\n,\n59\n,\n172\nPatients with risk factors for poor attendance should not be excluded from programs.\u2028Identify\n                              barriers to participation at program entry and offer support to overcome the barriers.\u2028Offer\n                              current smokers pharmacological help and smoking cessation counselling.\u2028If possible,\n                              refer patients to a PRP closest to their home.\u2028Schedule classes to avoid peak traffic\n                              times and thus reduce journey time.\u2028Overcome difficulties with transport/journey time\n                              for patients without personal or family transport by offering subsidized options where\n                              available (e.g. taxis or hospital transport) and accessible parking.\u2028Consider one\n                              supervised session each week and three or four unsupervised sessions for patients\n                              unable to attend two sessions each week.\u2028Extend program for patients who miss sessions\n                              due to illness (e.g. acute exacerbations).\u2028Consider home\u2010based programs for severely\n                              dyspnoeic patients.\nFrequent flyers\nSome patients, despite completion of a PRP, experience ongoing problems (e.g. readmission\n                              to hospital with subsequent deconditioning, social problems affecting their ability\n                              to exercise) and are re\u2010referred to a program.\nAt commencement of a PRP, clearly state program duration and the expectation that\n                              the patient will complete the program.\u2028\u2018Graduate\u2019 patients by providing an appointment\n                              for reassessment at the completion of the program and to discuss maintenance options.\u2028Provide\n                              details about additional support, e.g. local or internet\u2010based patient support groups.\u2028Offer\n                              shorter \u2018booster\u2019 programs (e.g. 4\u2010week duration) following severe exacerbations to\n                              revise patient's home exercise program and re\u2010establish a regular exercise regimen.\nAnxious or depressed patient\nSome patients are anxious about attending an \u2018exercise program\u2019 fearing that they\n                              will lose control of their breathing in a public situation.\u2028Patients may be concerned\n                              that they will contract infections from other patients in the program.\nBe aware of patient anxiety before entry into a PRP and reassure the patient that\n                              they will cope in the program and are likely to benefit.\u2028Explain the benefits of group\n                              support and improved self\u2010confidence associated with PRP.\u2028Orientate patients to the\n                              facility, including the location of chairs and toilets.\u2028Invite patients to observe\n                              an exercise class before participating.\u2028Arrange referral to a mental health professional\n                              if available.\u2028Encourage good cough/sneeze etiquette and respiratory hygiene (e.g.\n                              disposing of used tissues appropriately) during the classes. Hand washing and cleaning\n                              of exercise equipment should be undertaken in accordance with facility\u2010based protocols.\u2028Educate\n                              patients entering a PRP about the signs and symptoms of respiratory infection and\n                              not to attend classes during the acute stage of an infection.\nPRP, pulmonary rehabilitation program.\nEVALUATING A PULMONARY REHABILITATION PROGRAM\nEvaluation of a PRP is an essential component of continuous quality improvement. Each\n            program should be evaluated in terms of: (i) referral and attendance patterns; (ii)\n            outcomes such as exercise capacity and HRQoL in the patient cohort; and (iii) patient\n            feedback.\nAt 12\u2010monthly intervals, the coordinator should review the program by summarizing\n            the number of referrals, uptake of pulmonary rehabilitation (i.e. the number who attend\n            baseline assessment and enrol in the program), attendance (i.e. the average number\n            of supervised sessions completed) and attrition (i.e. the number who drop\u2010out of the\n            program). Reasons for poor uptake, attendance and attrition should be noted and, where\n            possible, strategies implemented to improve these factors.\nThe average change for outcomes such as exercise capacity and HRQoL should be calculated\n            for patients grouped according to respiratory diagnosis (e.g. COPD, ILD, etc.). Where\n            appropriate, the magnitude of change for these outcomes can be compared with the established\n            minimal important difference (see\nTable\u20033\n). For example, those programs that use the CRDQ to measure HRQoL should aim to achieve\n            an average increase of 10 points for the total score.\n78\nPrograms that achieve an average increase of \u226510 points in the CRDQ can be confident\n            that the improvement was large enough to be noticed by the average patient. Staff\n            involved in these programs should also aim to compare the average change observed\n            in their program with other programs. This can be achieved by comparing changes with\n            those reported in the literature, at conference presentations or by contacting coordinators\n            of other local PRP.\nOn program completion, it useful to ask patients to complete a satisfaction questionnaire.\n42\nQuestions should focus on the content of the PRP and offer the opportunity to expand\n            on answers if required. Allowing patients to give feedback anonymously may increase\n            response rate and the amount of information provided.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe global burden of lung disease is increasing, in part due to earlier detection\n            and the ageing population. Low\u2010cost strategies to improve the health of individuals\n            with lung disease are necessary. Pulmonary rehabilitation is an intervention for which\n            there is compelling evidence of benefit and one that has been shown to be cost\u2010effective.\n            This review has provided a stepwise approach to enable clinicians to establish, deliver\n            and evaluate a PRP.", "keyword_list": [], "reference_list": []}

This\n         review article provides an overview of many of the ways to measure well\u2010being and\n         happiness. It attempts to cover three distinct, but interrelated subjects.
