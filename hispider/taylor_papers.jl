The value of a fundamental religious behaviour, prayer, is determined using the well-being valuation method. Theoretically appropriate Instrumental Variables (IV) are used to avoid bias in estimating the effects of household income and the frequency of prayer on well-being. The marginal value of an additional weekly prayer session for individuals already at the national mean is estimated to be $6550 per annum (2004 dollars). Praying at the frequency of the national mean of 8.1 prayer sessions weekly is valued at $53\u2009055 (2004 dollars) per annum. This is larger than the median household income in the US in 2004: $44\u2009684. This suggests that the perception of communion with God is highly valued by religious individuals.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00036846.2011.648318", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "well-being", "happiness", "prayer", "religion", "JEL Classification::", "A13", "I31"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Andrews, FM and Withey, SB. 1976.

(2006) Devolution, sustainability and GDP convergence: is the Welsh agenda achievable?, \n \n, 679\u2013689. The Welsh Assembly Government has a constitutional duty to promote sustainable development. The devolution settlement does not, however, empower the Assembly to deviate from UK tax rates, while the Assembly Government has itself adopted ambitious gross domestic product growth targets. Here, the paper considers notions of sustainability and it attempts to place the Welsh agenda within those conceptual approaches. It then discusses the significance of the absence of tax variation as an instrument for generating relative sustainability gains. In particular, it examines the regional relevance of the \u2018double-dividend\u2019 argument that governments can substitute efficient environmental taxes for inefficient labour-market taxes. Finally, it considers the implications for sustainability of promoting quality of life, or happiness, achievement above the gross domestic product as the main goal of policy. The lessons drawn should be of relevance to other semi-autonomous regions.\nM\n L., J\n R. et B\n D.

We estimated life satisfaction and happiness level using various sociodemographic and socioeconomic determinants for a case of a developing country by using Thailand as an empirical study. We find that income has no effect on life satisfaction while having a statistically significant effect on happiness. Similarly, gender has no effect on being satisfied with life but has a statistically significant effect on happiness. The results for marital status suggest that people who are single are as happy as but are less satisfied with life than those who are married. Being divorced or widowed, however, reduces happiness. The effects of some life satisfaction/happiness determinants may significantly change after controlling for endogeneity of income.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2015.1083501", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Developing countries", "happiness", "income", "life satisfaction", "subjective well-being", "Thailand"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Argyle, M.

The menopause transition and special issues influencing the health of women as they age can affect quality of life. The assessment of these effects requires a variety of validated instruments to capture their influence in a variety of populations and for a variety of outcomes. This review identifies the important measurement properties of HRQOL instruments, determinants of health status and the currently available measures of HRQOL. Specifically, the reliability, validity and applicability of HRQOL instruments designed for use at the climacteric are individually discussed. It is important to choose validated and appropriate instruments depending on the individual or population being assessed and the relevant HRQOL issues.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13697130801936739", "keyword_list": ["Quality of Life", "Measurement of Quality of Life", "Quality of Life and Aging", "Health-related Quality of Life", "Menopause-specific Quality of Life Scales", "Practical Considerations"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Fries J F, Green L W, Levine S.

Differences from young adults quality of life (QoL) (20\u201330\u00a0years) could add justification.\n: Preliminary psychometric properties of the adult WHOQOL-BREF were examined in 208 adolescents and 204 young adults. Unhealthy adolescents diagnosed with acne or elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D) were compared with healthy adolescents. Cognitive interviewing used \u2018think aloud\u2019 techniques with six healthy adolescents during WHOQOL-BREF completion. Concepts and wording were thematically analysed for relevance, comprehension and comprehensiveness.\n: Little data were missing from the WHOQOL-BREF suggesting some feasibility and acceptability to adolescents. Compared with adults, adolescents perceived greater access to information, a better home environment, worse pain, and medication dependency. Internal consistency reliability for adolescents was good (\n\u00a0=\u00a0.89), especially psychological and environmental QoL. Content validity especially for social and environment domains was supported. Domains validly discriminated between high- and low-depressive symptoms but not acne groups. Additional new facets on autonomy, altruism and physical fitness and changed item contents are proposed.\n: The evidence indicates that developing a new adolescent version is justifiable.

Nor has the intersection of disability and emotions been used as a lens to examine the history of disability. Our paper aims at filling this academic void by analysing a wide range of philosophical, anthropological, pedagogical, popular and poetic texts dealing with the following question: \u201cWho is unhappiest, the blind or the deaf?\u201d On the basis of a comparative study of Belgian, Dutch, German, Swiss, Austrian, British and American primary source material, we argue that the transformation of western concepts of happiness during the nineteenth century was reflected in attitudes towards people with sensory disabilities. If at the turn of the eighteenth century happiness was considered a sensory experience, it very soon became dependent on the intervention of an educational expert. On the basis of our source material we draw the conclusion that happiness has been an overlooked factor in the construction and problematisation of disability in western societies. Analysis of the ways in which nineteenth-century authors have dealt with this question also shows how happiness became connected to new ways of wielding power, and in particular to the rise of the educational expert.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00309230.2014.899374", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "happiness", "disability history", "deafness", "blindness", "education", "expertise"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": []}

This study on the quality of life, in a typical East African slum, is based on fieldwork carried out in Mathare, Nairobi. The research revealed that Mathare residents prioritise sanitation, waste management and access to water, electricity, education and healthcare as the most essential services for adding quality to their lives. However, one of the main conclusions of this research is that although improved service delivery is necessary, it may not be sufficient in satisfying the quality of life requirements of Mathare residents. Other aspects of economics, such as regular employment as well as socio-cultural issues, like freedom from fear and access to communal security, are equally important and policy objectives should pay holistic attention to both the objective living conditions and the subjective life satisfaction indicators of slum dwellers.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09709274.2013.11906569", "keyword_list": ["Key Words:", "Quality of Life", "Slum", "Urbanisation", "Nairobi"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Atte OD 1983.

Today, we witness the closing in of the parameters of choice from increasing societal demands for energy, material goods and commodities, access to sources of clean water, air and soil, and higher standards of living on the one hand, and decreasing availability of non-renewable sources of energy, arable land, geopolitical stability and a more meaningful quality of life on the other. This article considers general approaches to dealing with the mounting pressures caused by this narrowing of the funnel of strategic choice for human civilizational development in balanced harmony with Earth. It explores the limitations and assumptions inherent in models based on growth, development and evolution. By considering the classical evolutionary economics of Joseph Schumpeter and the emerging evolutionary systems design perspective of contemporary evolutionary change agents, it surfaces key patterns in the quest for meaningful indices of progress. In the final analysis, this article argues for a humanistic and essentially non-quantitative appreciation of life. It suggests that meaningful progress be advanced through the development of an evolutionarily attuned mindset, skillset and heartset, capable of grasping the often non-linear leaps of logic required for the cultivation of patterns of being and becoming that foster global thrivability.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1386/jots.9.1.9_1", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "growth", "development", "evolution", "sustainability", "standard of living", "quality of life", "syntony", "thrivability"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Boyle, D. and Simms, A.

It evaluates the extent to which EJ occurs in SWM and discusses the factors accounting for this state of affairs. The paper examines the relevant theoretical framework(s) and mechanisms that would facilitate the attainment of EJ in Kinshasa. It is argued that solid waste (SW) often ends up in the poorest and least powerful communities in the cities of the DRC. A qualitative research methodology, which includes exhaustive critical review of the literature, system analysis, reflections from best practices through case studies and discussion with stakeholders, was used for this study. Findings revealed that SWM in Kinshasa is a duty entrusted to publicly-funded municipal authorities. There are evidences of a clear divide between the rich and poor neighbourhoods in the manner SW is managed. This is an inequality that has only recently begun to be recognised as injustice practices in SWM. It is argued that a politico-cultural mechanism on remedying SWM inequities could enable changes that will address EJ in Kinshasa. Such a solution will go directly against the prevailing notion \u201csome happy, others sad\u201d.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2016.1242120", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Cultural theory", "environmental justice", "some happy and others sad", "social solidarities", "solid waste management"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Ako, M., Anyidoho, N., and Crawford, G., 2013.

The paper analyses and compares the indicators of quality of life in Lithuania with other countries. A quality of life is an explicit or implicit policy goal. Various measurements and indicators to evaluate a quality of life were proposed during the recent years however there are no widely accepted objective indicators of quality of life able to compare countries. Sustainable development concept proposes new approach to measure quality of life. Therefore the aim of sustainable development is to increase quality of life. Quality of life can be addressed in terms of people health, the state of economy, employment, infrastructure development, crime and environment. All these indicators are interrelated as economic development creates preconditions to maintain public health, develop social and technical infrastructure, to increase employment, to ensure quality of environment, to tackle with crime etc. From the other point of view healthy and satisfied with the quality of life nation have positive impact on stable economic growth.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3846/20294913.2012.708676", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "sustainable development", "quality of life", "JEL Classification:", "E27", "E32"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["  \r\nBistrom  ,   E.     2010  .

As such, there remains a strong political desire for the comprehensive assessment of conditions that evaluate the current status, measure progress, and help set future development goals. Indicators have been nominated as universal tools for progressing sustainable development across scales; however, there remains no consensus regarding the best approach to their design or use. While several studies have investigated the associations between indicators of sustainable development, few have directly addressed the question of how multiple measures can be used simultaneously to assess sustainability regionally. Building upon previous studies, this paper presents a quantitative and spatial assessment of 25 multi-metric indices across 36 European nations. The goals of this research were (1) to increase understanding of indicator complexity and (2) provide an applied example of their simultaneous use for regional assessment. Global Moran\u2019s \n-test and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (\n) analysis were used to test spatial autocorrelation and multicollinearity, respectively. From the 25 composite indices, an overall rank was also provided for each country. Lastly, Ward\u2019s cluster analysis was used to create country bundles of similarity. Our findings revealed that environmental performance index, global information networking institute coefficient, and happy planet index were numerically and spatially random. Cluster analysis revealed a four-bundle solution, while Norway, Switzerland, and Sweden ranked highest.

During the war, Lebanon witnessed land, sea, and air blockade barring all food imports. Furthermore, the country's infrastructure, farmlands, seaports, bridges, and airport were all heavily bombarded and shelled. The blockade and the bombardment created a national food crisis and made it difficult for humanitarian agencies to transport food and aid supplies. Local food distributors were not able to transport goods, and warehouses were either selling out or having their products expire due to the absence of power. Being a nation that lacks a food policy and always susceptible to war, the country needs to create a food policy in order to maintain acceptable quality of life during difficult times.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/15378020801926833", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Lebanon", "war", "summer 2006", "food crisis", "quality of life"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Al Baba Trading Company. 2007.

Recently introduced in the DSM-5, craving is a potentially promising mechanism involved in relapse, but its articulation with quality of life and deprivation on tobacco student's consumers has never been investigated. \n Our study explores the relationship between tobacco craving and sub-dimensions of quality of life when controlling effect of deprivation on a youth population with tobacco consumption. \n Comparison between deprived and non-deprived students were conducted with online questionnaires on demographic data, level of dependency, perceived quality of life, deprivation and craving. Multivariate linear regression with backward procedure was conducted to assess the predictive validity of these variables on craving. Finally, Bayesian analysis was conducted to evaluate the model proposed by the regression. \n One hundred and seventy-four participants were included. Craving was significantly correlated with all the other variables and increases when the level of deprivation rises, while it decreases when physical health improves. These results are confirmed by Bayesian linear regression. \n Environmental and social factors are usually overlooked when it comes to understanding individuals, deeply rooted biological mechanisms such as craving. Working on physical health is of interest to diminished craving and improves the quality of life during smoking cessation and thereby to support success on the student population.

Having a partner or spouse and less chronic illness are positive factors affecting quality of life regardless of country of origin. Israeli born drug users reported better quality of life based on their psychological health and environment domain responses; no difference was found for the physical health and social relationship domains of the Israeli and former Soviet Union origin males. Because heroin addiction is a chronic and relapsing illness, one of the goals of methadone maintenance is to address patients\u2019 health status from a broad perspective. Based on clinical observations, the treatment of special populations may be enhanced if their particular needs are considered and met. Quality of life factors are relevant for assessing high risk groups, including those from different ethnic origins, in poor physical and psychological health, their treatment and personal adjustment, and their service personnel training needs.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/15332640.2015.1046009", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Ethnicity", "methadone treatment", "quality of life", "immigrants"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["AVERT.

As a result, errors and inconsistencies in the syntax of WHOQOL-HIV were found. In face of the fragility found, two new syntaxes for WHOQOL-HIV were proposed: (a) a correction of errors found in the original syntax; and (b) restructuration of the calculation of scores for WHOQOL-HIV, bringing it closer to the WHOQOL-100. Through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software, the syntaxes proposed were tested and compared to the syntax of the original WHOQOL-HIV. It was noted that both proposals met their respective purposes. They were also sent to researchers on the theme under consideration to verify the presence of errors. No irregularity was found. It can be concluded that the syntax of the WHOQOL-HIV differs significantly from the syntax of its precursor, the WHOQOL-100, presenting errors and inconsistencies.

Findings show that Dimensions 2, 4, and 6 have a significant influence on quality of life and the predictors of education, place of residence, age, and number of dependents (in the case of urban regions) affect quality of life through each of the three dimensions. Rural people have a better perceived quality of life than urban people. Based on the dimensions, the research shows that residents in the city of Assiut have a better perceived quality of life than residents in neighboring cities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/23754931.2016.1268971", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Assiut governorate", "Egypt", "quality of life", "quality of life perceptions", "rural and urban differences"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Andrews, F.

Although belief in the virtues of the compact city approach is now widespread among the policy community, questions remain relating to the \u2018sustainability versus liveability\u2019 implications of compact city environments. In this regard, while the public may support sustainability principles, there is a perception that high-density development poses too great a cost on individuals' quality of life. Combining both quantitative and qualitative research data, this paper evaluates the relationship between high-density living and neighbourhood satisfaction within the central city. Findings suggest that, in many instances, it is not high density \n that is the source of dissatisfaction for respondents, but rather other related factors such as environmental quality, noise, lack of community involvement, traffic and lack of services and facilities.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09640560903083798", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "compact city policy", "sustainable development", "neighbourhood", "quality of life"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Arigoni, D. 2001.

Recent interest in the development of social indicators has reflected a concern for the \u201cquality of life\u201d in many industrial nations, but a major problem has been the lack of a cohesive conceptual and theoretical framework. It is suggested that the well-established concept of level of living can provide such a framework. The concept is outlined in detail, with special reference to existing spatial applications. A working definition applicable to contemporary British conditions is proposed, and several important issues relating to the quantification of the concept are considered. It is concluded that within Britain there exists a sufficient range of indicators from which an index could be derived and used both as a descriptive instrument within regional and social geography and as the basis of a central, policy-oriented monitoring of regional variations in well-being.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09595237400185021", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Great Britain", "Index construction", "Level of living", "Quality of life", "Social indicators", "Spatial injustice", "Keywords:", "Gro\u00dfbritannien", "Lebensniveau", "Sozial Indikatoren", "Index-Konstruktion", "Lebensqualit\u00e4t", "R\u00e4umliche Nachteile", "Keywords:", "Grande-Bretagne", "Construction d'indice", "Niveau de vie", "Qualit\u00e9 de vie", "Indicateurs sociaux", "Injustice spatiale", "Keywords:", "\u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u044f", "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430", "\u0423\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438", "\u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438", "\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438", "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Agoc, C. 1970.

As the ageing population in Vietnam continues to increase, understanding important dimensions of QoL for the elderly is essential. There is a paucity of research in this area, however, and the available literature focuses on functional capacities. The purpose of this article is to explore perceptions on the dimensions of QoL among the elderly in Vietnam, to use these perceptions to broaden the concept, and to explore similarities and differences between those living in urban compared to rural areas.\n \n Qualitative methods included in-depth interviews (IDI) with experts in ageing and elderly persons, as well as focus group discussions (FGDs) in three communes in Hai Duong province. IDIs and FGDs were recorded and transcribed. NVivo software was used to analyse the data.\n \n Thematic analysis identified physical, psychological, social, environmental, religious, and economic as important dimensions of QoL. For elderly participants in both urban and rural areas, physical health, social relations, finances and economics, the physical and social environment, and psychological health were reported as important. Rural participants also identified religious practice as an important dimension of QoL. In terms of relationships, the elderly in urban areas prioritised those with their children, while the elderly in rural areas focussed their concerns on community relationships and economic conditions.\n \n Isolating individual factors that contribute to QoL among the elderly is difficult given the inter-relations and rich cross-linkages between themes. Elderly participants in urban and rural areas broadly shared perspectives on the themes identified, in particular social relationships, but their experiences diverged around issues surrounding finances and economics, their respective physical and social environments, and the contribution of religious practice. The study findings may help provide guidance for the development of a socially and culturally relevant instrument for measuring QoL among the elderly in Vietnam. The results will also be useful for developing policies and interventions that are responsive to the needs of the elderly, and reflect the themes perceived to be important.", "doi": "", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "quality of life", "elderly", "perception", "qualitative study", "Vietnam"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Witter S. \u2018Doi moi\u2019 and health: the effect of economic reforms on the health system in Vietnam.

The aim of this investigation was to study determinants of low HRQL in asthmatics and to study whether the determinants of HRQL differ between sexes and age groups. A cohort of three age groups in Sweden was investigated in 1990 using a questionnaire with focus on respiratory symptoms. To study quality of life, the generic instrument Gothenburg Quality of Life was used. The participants were also investigated with interviews, spirometry, and allergy testing. Asthma was diagnosed in 616 subjects. Fifty-eight per cent (\n = 359) of the subjects were women; and 24% were smokers, 22% ex-smokers, and 54% were non-smokers. Women were more likely than men to report poor health-related quality of life. Respiratory symptoms severity was another independent determinant of a lower quality of life as well as airway responsiveness to irritants. Current and former smokers also reported lower quality of life. Finally, absenteeism from school and work was associated with lower quality of life. Factors such as sex, smoking habits, airway responsiveness to irritants, respiratory symptom severity, allergy, and absenteeism from school and work were associated with low HRQL in asthmatics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/03009734.2011.638730", "keyword_list": ["Asthma", "GQL", "generic instrument", "quality of life"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Masoli M, Fabian D, Holt S, Beasley R.

The World Health Organization QoL questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), which contains four separate domains, was used to assess QoL. Incidence rates of IHD and stroke were recorded during follow-up. Socioeconomic demographic data including marital state, educational level, occupation, income and place of living and metabolic risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidaemia, body mass index and smoking were also recorded.\n More IHD (42%) and stroke (57%) patients were illiterate; while the educational status was significantly different only in the IHD group (\n 0.000). Differences in income and occupation were notable in patients with stroke and IHD, respectively, compared to subjects without them (\n 0.050). DM and HTN were significantly higher in IHD and stroke patients in comparison with subjects without CVE (\n 0.000). Two-way multivariate analyses of covariance test after age, educational status and metabolic risk factors adjustment showed that subjects with stroke had a significantly higher score in all QoL domains in comparison with individuals without stroke (\n 0.050). There was no significant association between QoL domains and IHD incidence (\n 0.050).\n This study indicates that there is no association between QoL and IHD incidence although there was a significant relationship between higher QoL and incidence of stroke.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/AC.71.2.3141853", "keyword_list": ["Key Words:", "Quality of life", "ischaemic heart diseases", "stroke"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Go AS, Mozaffarian D, Roger VL, Benjamin EJ, Berry JD, Blaha MJ, Dai 5, Ford ES, Fox CS, Franco 5, Fullerton HJ, Gillespie C, Hailpern SM, Heit JA, Howard VJ, Huffman MD, Judd SE, Kissela BM, Kittner SJ, Lackland DT, Lichtman JH, Lisabeth LD, Mackey RH, Magid DJ, Marcus GM, Marelli A, Matchar DB, McGuire DK, Mohler ER 3rd, Moy CS, Mussolino ME, Neumar RW, Nichol G, Pandey DK, Paynter NP, Reeves MJ, Sorlie PD, Stein J, Towfighi A, Turan TN, Virani SS, Wong ND, Woo D, Turner MB; American Heart Association Statistics Committee and Stroke Statistics Subcommittee.

The paper also seeks to highlight the different dimensions and complexities of seeking to monitor and improve well-being through transport policy. It will in turn be argued that the varied and complex sets of outcomes that arise from transport policy interventions, and the multiple ways in which they affect well-being, make a well-being approach (that measures policy outcomes in terms of units of well-being) of particular value for policy-makers.

WHOQOL-Bref (World Health Organization Quality of Life) Scale was used to assess multi-dimensional domains of QOL (physical, psychological, social and environmental health). The patients were evaluated clinically using PANSS and followed up for 6 months. Multivariate analyses were carried out to outline the symptoms which are predictive of QOL in these patients.\n Physical well-being as assessed with WHOQOL-Bref is significantly impacted by the positive, negative and general psychopathology symptoms of the disease. General psychopathology symptoms demonstrated a strong relationship with different facets of QOL. These symptoms are predictive of physical (\n=0.025) and psychological health (\n=0.026), social relationships (\n=0.009) and environmental QOL (\n=0.022). \n The general psychopathology symptoms significantly impact QOL in a diverse manner. Negative symptoms have a greater influence than positive symptoms on subjective QOL. \n The antipsychotics focus on primary positive and negative disease symptoms. There is a need to develop a holistic approach (target non-psychotic symptoms intensively) in the disease management to prevent further long-term impairment of QOL.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/08039488.2012.687768", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Quality of life", "psychopathology", "schizophrenia", "first-episode", "PANSS"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Naber D, Moritz S, Lambert M, Pajonk FG, Holzbach R, Mass R, et al.

What is at issue is whether population growth is detrimental to or beneficial for economic development. Neither of the extreme views gives a complete picture of the interplay among population, resources, and quality of life. Following previous literature on the topic, this paper establishes a more balanced approach that considers the function linking population and quality of life not constant but variable and regards the limitedness of resources as not absolute but relative to regions and societies. The proposed approach is more flexible in better explaining the relation between population and economic growth. China is examined as a case in point to shed light on the interaction of population growth, economic development, and available resources, and its recent post-economic reform experiences showcase the appropriateness of the synthetic approach.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/10042857.2012.10685078", "keyword_list": ["population growth", "migration", "natural resources", "economic development", "quality of life"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Abeysinghe, T and Lu, D. 2003.

Information was acquired on the effects that the condition had on participants with regard to symptoms, quality of life, disease management and treatment.\n A cross-sectional study design was used. A self-administered anonymous questionnaire was distributed to all medical students registered with the Faculty of Health Sciences at UFS in 2016. The estimated population was 706 students.\n The response rate was 62.6%. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis was 39.1%. The most common symptoms were rhinorrhoea (64.8%), repeated sneezing (64.3%) and nasal obstruction (58.5%). Symptoms were at their worst during August to October. Antihistamines had been used by 82.4% of participants to treat their symptoms in the previous 12\u00a0months, while 28.8% had used an intranasal steroid spray.\n The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in medical students at UFS was 39.1%.

The sustainable city requires new approach models as the suburban-district development model, such as the garden city, is considered eco-friendly but reveals duplicity due to its damaging greenbelt land. This paper thus proposes a new model for Korean-style green growth through the integrated concepts of the compact city, smart growth, and sustainability. The Korean-type green-growth city can become a solution to the climate change issue, thanks to its bilateral balance between city development and environment protection. The city can be developed to become the nation's new growth driver through the cultivation of green industries, and is believed to have the potential to improve the quality of life of the city people through the construction of sustainable regional communities across the econo-enviro-cultural fields.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/2093761X.2012.745802", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "sustainability", "quality of life", "smart growth", "green growth", "city competitiveness"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": [" P.

In this paper, argue that a growing focus on frontier technologies in the life sciences in discussions about bio-power today has come at the cost of empirical investigations into how, for example, \u2018quality of life\u2019 came to be a crucial object of bio-power in the 20th century. Just as Foucault outlined the emergence of a multiple body\u2014the population\u2014in the 18th century, I suggest, building on work by Rose, Rabinow and Hacking, that we can also discern the emergence of a multiple subjectivity\u2014state of civilisation, public opinion, human capability, national attitudes, culture\u2014as scientific and political problem. If bio-politics deals with the population as a biological and political problem, then what we might think of as an anthropo-politics deals with a collective subjectivity as a psychological, sociological and/or anthropological problem that can be measured, mapped out and intervened upon in much the same way that mortality rates, life expectancy or morbidity rates can. By analysing the concrete ways in which human progress has been globally measured and taxonomised in the past two centuries or so, I will show how global stratifications of countries according to their states of \u2018civilisation\u2019, \u2018development\u2019 and more recently \u2018human capability\u2019, have relied not just on the population as biological object, but also on a collective subjectivity. Using this analysis, I will go on to conclude that the politics of life is in no way limited to biological contestations and problems, but equally importantly includes psychological, sociological and anthropological problematisations about what a \u2018good\u2019, \u2018healthy\u2019 or \u2018quality\u2019 life is and how they might be measured.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/1600910X.2007.9672939", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Bio-power", "Foucault", "human capability", "human progress", "life", "population", "quality of life", "subjectivity"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Ackerknecht, Erwin H. 1971 [1942].

This has both positive and negative impacts on the everyday lives of residents (or their urban liveability as perceived by them), even though urban consolidation is commonly resisted by residents. This paper aims to better understand impacts of urban consolidation on liveability by comparing similarities and differences in impacts between two Brisbane suburbs: an outer fringe suburb (Wynnum) and an inner city suburb (West End). Wynnum residents generally expressed less resistance to urban consolidation, with some residents willing to trade additional densification for additional amenities. Two issues concerning residents in both suburbs were aesthetics of high-rise development and traffic congestion. Building heights more than a few storeys above surrounding buildings were commonly seen as detracting from urban liveability, though buildings up to 30 stories were accepted by some if close to the Commercial Business District. Traffic congestion was seen as a problem in both suburbs reflecting widespread car dependency. Other impacts differed between suburbs, reflecting their different values and ways of living. For example, most West End residents were concerned about losing social diversity with declining housing affordability while many Wynnum residents were concerned about gaining more public or social housing and disadvantaged residents. The impacts of urban consolidation on liveability differ between suburbs, and local neighbourhood plans should be sensitive to local notions of urban liveability because residents often stay after urban consolidation, even if they perceive negative impacts on their liveability. These interviews reinforce liveability as primary focus for urban planning, and thus urban consolidation at the expense of liveability is a poor outcome for both local residents and urban planning.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14036096.2011.641261", "keyword_list": ["Densification", "Sprawl", "Planning", "NIMBY", "Sustainability", "Quality of life"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Aero, T. 2006.

Although researchers have recognized a close association between patient-oriented recovery and health-related quality of life (HRQOL), the relation between the recovery components and patients\u2019 self-reported HRQOL is still unknown. The purpose of the present study was therefore to use structural equation modelling to predict HRQOL of schizophrenia outpatients from the recovery components proposed by SAMHSA.\n: The recovery status of 201 outpatients with schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorder was measured using 12 variables that indicate the outcome of 10 recovery components. Canonical correlation analysis was applied to screen variables that are highly correlated with HRQOL. Valid variables were then used to build a structural model that predicted individuals\u2019 HRQOL as indicated by the World Health Organization Quality of Life Measure Abbreviated (WHOQOL-BREF (HK)).\n: The bestfit model was able to explain 80.7% of the variance in WHOQOL-BREF outcome. The model demonstrated significant direct and indirect effects of five recovery components on HRQOL. The effect of psychosocial symptoms on HRQOL was highest (total \n = \u22120.64), followed by sense of personal agency (total \n = 0.58), sense of optimism (total \n = 0.54), perceived support (total \n = 0.47), and internal stigma (total \n = \u22120.42).\n: The recovery components proposed by the SAMHSA consensus statement provided a useful framework to explain HRQOL of outpatients with schizophrenia. The present model indicated a moderate to large effect of five major recovery components on HRQOL. It showed that patients\u2019 perceptions of support, optimism, and personal agency were influenced by psychosocial symptoms and internal stigma.

Six focus group discussions about music in everyday life were conducted and data were analysed using template analysis based on the QoL model of the World Health Organisation Quality of Life BREF questionnaire.\n A theoretical framework of the impact of music on the QoL was developed. Music was reported to contribute to many aspects of physical, psychological, and social well-being in adult CI users. These positive effects of music on QoL were similar to what has been reported in the literature for normal-hearing adults. However, difficulties in music perception and enjoyment were found to have a negative impact on CI users\u2019 QoL, especially by causing unpleasant feelings and limited participation in music-related or routine daily activities.\n These findings suggest that an improvement in music experiences of CI users may lead to improvements in QoL and therefore support the need for music rehabilitation.

The changing socio-economic circumstances that enhance leisure and tourism, are also examined. Leisure activities are highly related to income, and changing lifestyles in Iran over the past few decades. Increased discretionary time does not mean that everyone is in a position to take it up. Moreover, as a result of globalization of norms and values, the value of leisure and tourism is becoming evidenced in Iran like in many other countries. Iran, with a heavy volume of her population, in the younger age groups of 15\u201329, is facing controversial issues in leisure and tourism. The new millennium is witnessing tourism as becoming the largest industry. Such a growing phenomenon requires sustainable thoughtful planning and investment. If adequate planning is not applied, changing consumer needs, expectations, fashions and the like will not be met in an effective way. The author recommends that new interrelations, knowledge and facts should be discovered so as to respond the growing leisure and tourism needs. The paper proposes that thoughtful policy-making could minimize or even remove the likely negative effects of tourism. Eventually, in the last part of the article, various data on leisure and tourism are discussed.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/04419057.2004.9674375", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Leisure Activities", "Quality of Life", "Tourist Attractions", "Globalization"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Abeles, R.

This article discusses four key dimensions that specifically define the scope of tourism: economic, social, cultural, and environmental, and with the analyses of empirical data from Saudi Arabia these dimensions are tested for their relationship with the broader demographic variables of Saudi Arabia. The data was collected through questionnaire from a sample of 775 local residents who lived in the Makkah region\u2014the destination of Muslim pilgrims from all over the world. A simple regression and t-test analyses were carried out to examine the study hypotheses. The regression analysis showed that tourism had a fairly direct impact on the quality of life of the residents. The t-test analysis demonstrated that several demographic factors were significantly related to the four dimensions of tourism. As such, this article provides a valuable examination of residents' perceptions and their quality of life with regards to the scope of tourism development in the Makkah region. This study potentially contributes to future research in the fairly conservative societal and cultural context of tourism in Saudi Arabia, and provides key parameters for an improved understanding of tourism impacts, planning and policy-making for the tourism industry, and \u201csustainable\u201d tourism marketing.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/19368623.2012.627226", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Saudi Arabia", "tourism impact", "quality of life", "community perceptions"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Abrams, M. 1973.

The instrument reflected the differences in QOL scores among different age groups, indicating known-groups validity, and revealed good criterion-related validity when FACT-L was used as the criterion. The instrument detected changes of QOL with higher standardized response mean for the patients before and after treatment. \n The Chinese version of QLQ-LC43 can be used to measure QOL for Chinese patients with lung cancer with good validity, reliability and responsiveness.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/07357900701781788", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Lung cancer", "Quality of life", "Validation", "Standardized response mean"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Parkin D.

After a review of the relevant literature and statistical analysis of a survey data for 390 elderly respondents in studio apartments, it was found that age-segregation have a deleterious impact on the quality of life of the elderly people. Furthermore, it was found that the perception of the elderly in relation to factors that are most significant to their quality of life is at variance with that of the policy makers. This implies that there is a need for policy makers and service providers to review their existing policies, products and services so as to be more effective in providing housing options for the rapidly aging population of Singapore.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/02763890802097151", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Age-segregation", "quality of life", "elderly people", "studio apartment"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Altman, I, Lawton, M.

Since World War II, the newspaper press has firmly established that country towns were threatened by decline. Yet media images of decline are not always negative. In fact, many advantages traditionally identified with the ideal country life are ironically dependent on the very factors that created anxiety about decline. By contrasting images of country life with the urban sprawl and identifying quality of life in a country setting, newspapers have presented symptoms of decline as desirable. They have also increasingly portrayed the past as aesthetically pleasing and championed the cause of local history. By exploring three representations of decline in metropolitan and country newspapers \u2013 their images of population trends, the good life and the past \u2013 this article discusses the ways that the symptoms of decline came to be reinterpreted to have positive associations for country towns.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.5172/rsj.2012.21.2.85", "keyword_list": ["Keyword:", "country towns", "local newspapers", "decline", "progress", "local history", "heritage", "population", "quality of life", "rural life"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["A freebie from Peter.

An effective self-management plan helps patients to gain information about and skills in life style modifications, self-monitoring, and environmental control. The study, both descriptive and analytic, was planned as a means to evaluate the need of asthmatic patients for self-management education and to design supportive educational programs. The study group consisted of 42 adult patients who were chosen randomly from among patients treated in the Chest Diseases Department of the Medical Faculty of Istanbul University. The following evaluation tools were used: St. George Respiratory Questionnaire, a questionnaire designed by the research team, and patients' asthma diaries. The survey form designed by the research team included questions about demographic characteristics, asthma triggering factors, and morbidity factors. An asthma educational program, consisting of one session that lasted for 120 minutes, was implemented by doctors and nurses in cooperation and, 2 months later, patients were followed up. After completion of the educational program, it was found that patients related their health during the last month and the extent to which they drew benefits from their treatment with higher scores, the result clearly stating that the impact of asthma on their lives has experienced a decrease. The educational program was thus implemental in improving the quality of patients' lives.

The data collected from Italy showed that around 3 million women are affected by endoemtriosis and the condition was predominantly found in women of reproductive age (50% of women were in the 29\u201339 age range), only 25% of women were asymptomatic. The associated symptoms can create an impact in general physical, mental, and social well-being. Endometriosis is associated with severe dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain, ovulation pain, cyclical, or perimenstrual symptoms, with or without abnormal bleeding, infertility, and chronic fatigue. The annual cost for hospital admission can be estimated to be in a total around 54 million euros. The average time for right diagnosis is around 9 years still today and it follows a long and expensive diagnostic search. Therapies can be useful to relieve and sometimes solve the symptoms, encourage fertility, eliminate endometrial lesions, and restore the anatomy of the pelvis. For medical therapy, several different preparations (oral contraceptives, progestogenics, gestrinone, danazol, and GnRHa) and new options (GnRH antagonists, aromatase inhibitors, estrogen receptor beta agoinist, progesterone receptor modulators, angiogenesis inhibitors, and COX-2 selective inhibitors) are available.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/09513590903159664", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Endometriosis", "pelvic pain", "medical treatment", "vaginal danazol", "quality of life"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Farquhar CM.

Psychological factors such as anxiety and depression are increasingly being recognized as influencing the onset and course of asthma. \n. We obtained Patient Health Questionnaire 8 depression data from 41 states and territories using the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Heath risk behaviors, social and emotional support, life satisfaction, disability, and four health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) questions were available for all states and territories (n = 18,856 with asthma). Five additional HRQOL questions were asked in three states (n = 1345 persons with asthma), and questions assessing asthma control were available for nine states (n = 3943 persons with asthma). \n. Persons with asthma were significantly more likely than those without asthma to have current depression (19.4% vs. 7.7%), a lifetime diagnosis of depression (30.6% vs. 14.4%), and anxiety (23.5% vs. 10.2%). For most domains examined, there was a dose-response relationship between level of depression severity and mean number of days of impaired HRQOL in the past 30 days, as well as an increased prevalence of life dissatisfaction, inadequate social support, disability, and risk behaviors, such as smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity, among those with asthma. Moreover, depression and anxiety were associated with a decreased level of asthma control, including more visits to the doctor or emergency room, inability to do usual activities, and more days of symptoms compared to those without depression or anxiety. \n.

Moreover, there is little information about the measures that can be taken to increase or at least maintain mobility in older age.\n \n A systematic literature review was undertaken to address the issues associated with the transportation and mobility needs of older road users. Articles and publications were selected for relevance and research strength and strategies and measures aimed to manage the safe mobility of older road users were reviewed.\n \n The review provides clear evidence that, for older adults who cease driving, quality of life is reduced and that there are a number of adverse consequences of poor mobility. The misconceptions regarding the risks that older drivers pose on the road and how their safe mobility should be managed are discussed, particularly the implications of current licensing procedures on mobility. Evidence is also presented showing there are subgroups of older adults who are more likely to suffer more pronounced mobility consequences including women and financially disadvantaged groups. Moreover, \u201cbest-practice\u201d strategies for maintaining at least some level of mobility for older adults are highlighted in four broad categories: safer road users, safer vehicles, safer roads and infrastructure, and provision of new and innovative alternative transport options that are specifically tailored to older adults.\n \n Provision of safe travel options that allow easy access to services and amenities is a vital factor in maintaining mobility amongst older road users. An understanding that continued mobility means access to a private vehicle, either as a driver (for as long as possible as it is safe to drive) or as a passenger, and easy and practical access to other forms of transport is essential in the management of health, well-being, and the safe mobility of older road users.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/15389580801895285", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Older", "Safety", "Mobility", "Transport", "Quality of Life", "Counter Measure"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Banister, D and Bowling, A. 2004.

The findings of the study showed that the intervention efforts of the regime were not far reaching enough.

Although often addressed in tourism studies within broad-ranging social impact research, prostitution in tourism destinations deserves independent investigation due to its complex nature. This study was conducted to investigate the opinions of Macau residents on prostitution and related social issues. We collected data using a questionnaire, which revealed the following results. Respondents tended to regard prostitution as a permanent part of the Macau community and believed that the likelihood of the government being able to eliminate prostitution through legislation was extremely low. Their perceptions of prostitution could be placed within the dichotomy of deviance and normativeness. Regarding prostitution as a normative existence was positively related to the acceptance of sex tourism. A tolerance of negative tourism impacts was associated with residents\u2019 perceived quality of life.

This study aims to investigate the neighborhood environmental variables, the outcome active aging, and potential variables that inhibit active aging in the elderly that lead to their quality of life. It examined quality-of-life determinants that are influenced by the existence of certain neighborhood characteristics. In the study, 385 older adults aged 60+ years residing in two different cities in Malaysia were surveyed. Multiple regression was used to explore how much variance in active aging variables the neighborhood environmental factors explained as a group. The results showed that permeability, accessibility, and facilitators to walking are key determinants of active aging. There is a need to improve the physical design of the neighborhoods with regard to these three factors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/02763893.2016.1268560", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Quality of life", "Active aging", "Neighborhood Characteristics", "Older adults"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Alley, D., Liebig, P., Pynoos, J., Banerjee, T., & Choi, I.

The secondary one was to assess the impact of asthma control on patients\u2019 health related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL), productivity loss, daily activities and psychological distress.\nMethods: A population-based, random-digit dialing, telephone nationwide survey was conducted to recruit patients with asthma. Among the responders, 3,946 met the age criterion (\u226518 years) and completed the screening questions regarding asthma. Of them, 353 subjects reported that they had been diagnosed with asthma sometime in their life and completed the survey. Data on demographic and lifestyle characteristics, asthma control, comorbidities, limitations in daily activities, psychological distress, productivity loss, as well as HRQoL, were collected through telephone interview.\nResults: The lifetime self-reported prevalence of asthma was found to be 9.10% (95% CI:8.14%-9.94%). Sixty three percent of patients had well-controlled (WC) asthma. Asthma control was associated with gender, age, and specific comorbidities. Moreover, patients with not well-controlled (NWC) asthma were more likely to have missed work and reduced productivity during the past 12 months due to their asthma (p<0.01). Patients with NWC asthma were more likely to declare psychological distress and limitations in their daily living activities. Patients\u2019 HRQoL with NWC asthma was significantly worse (0.65\u00b10.24) compared to those with WC asthma (0.86\u00b10.17, p\u22640.001).\nConclusions: The results of this survey revealed the link between the asthma control and burden of disease demonstrating the need for the implementation of programs aiming at the management of chronic symptoms related to this condition.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2018.1471704", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Asthma", "survey", "burden of disease", "quality of life", "Greece"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": []}

The decade also witnessed the emergence of new theories, concepts and research themes that were to have an enduring influence on the nature of the subject. Prominent in this new research portfolio were issues related to quality of life in the city. This paper outlines the main developments in urban geography in the 1980s with particular reference to themes relating to quality-of-life research. The discussion introduces the concept of \"useful knowledge\" within the context of \"applied urban geography\"; examines the key dimensions of quality-of-life research in urban geography; and concludes by adopting a prospective viewpoint to identify a number of quality-of-life issues of significance for the urban geography of the 21st century.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2747/0272-3638.24.4.314", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "cities", "useful knowledge", "applied urban geography", "quality of life"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": [" Barclay, P., 1995,  Inquiry into Income and Wealth .

Participants were assessed on the WHOQOL-100, a self-assessment instrument designed for quantifying 24 facets relating to quality of life. These facets are grouped into six larger domains: physical health, psychological health, level of independence, social relationships, environment, and spirituality. The WHOQOL-100 also includes one facet examining overall quality of life and general health perceptions. Analyses revealed that the CFS group reported significantly lower levels of quality of life than the control group on overall quality of life and general health perceptions and on 22 out of the 24 facets of quality of life. Compared to earlier studies that used health-status scales or rather limited quality of life measures, this study generated a more complete picture of the problems of patients with CFS. The results suggest that the impact of CFS on the patients' lives is very profound. CFS has a qual-ity-of-life burden that affects a wide range of factors inherent to quality of life.

Therefore, in the last decade, international interest has focussed on the study of quality of life (QoL) in older people. Our aim was to study the psychometric properties of the generic QoL measure WHOQOL-BREF (WHOQOL, World Health Organization Quality of Life) and specific older adult module WHOQOL-OLD in a sample of 286 Spanish elderly.\n \n Participants were 60 years and older from community centres, primary care centres, family associations and nursing homes. The following information was collected: demographics, self-perception of health, depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS-30), functional status (SF-12) and QoL (WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD). Analysis was performed using classic psychometric techniques with SPSS v15.0.\n \n We found no ceiling and floor effects, and missing data was low. The internal consistency measured by Cronbach's alpha was 0.90 for the WHOQOL-BREF total scale and 0.80 for the WHOQOL-OLD. \n expected associations were found between WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD with the SF-12 and the GDS-30, indicating good construct validity. WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD domain scores differentiated between participants with lower and higher level of education, and between groups of older people (healthy vs. unhealthy; non-depressed vs. depressed; non-carers vs. carers and non-residents vs. residents).\n \n The WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD questionnaires demonstrate acceptable psychometric performance in a convenience sample of Spanish older people.

However, there was lack of empirical evidence of the Olympic Games long-term effects in local societies. Thus, this study explored the importance of legacy outcomes for residents' quality of life in four Summer Olympic cities: Atlanta, Sydney, Athens, and Beijing. The study utilized survey research with the four cities residents. The questionnaires reflected the Olympic Games legacy outcomes as noted in International Olympic Committee official final Olympic Games reports. ANOVA and \n-tests were used to estimate how significant the outcomes were and whether demographics influenced residents' perceptions across the four cities. The results suggest that residents of Atlanta and Sydney value outcomes from the Games such as emotional investment and spaces associated with the Games that have a socialization dimension higher than residents of Athens and Beijing who value the more tangible outcomes as more important for their quality of life. All residents evaluated the importance of the outcomes for their quality of life in a positive light but differences were found within the different demographic profiles of the residents.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/16184742.2012.693118", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "legacy", "residents", "Olympic Games", "quality of life", "long-term evaluation"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Andranovich, G., Burbank, M.J. and Heying, C.H. 2001.

This study aims to assess the psychometric properties of the SCD-specific paediatric quality of life (PedsQL\u2122-SCD) and the revised illness perception questionnaires (IPQ-R) in Jamaican adolescents with SCD. One hundred and fifty Jamaican adolescents (M: 74, F: 76; mean age 16.1 \u00b1 1.9 years, range: 13\u201319 years) completed the IPQ-R, PedsQL\u2122-SCD (teen and parent forms) and a knowledge questionnaire. Socio-demographic and clinical data were also collected and the latter were used to create a severity index. Instruments\u2019 structure, feasibility, reliability and construct validity were assessed. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the 24-item knowledge questionnaire was 0.85; IPQ-R domains from 0.56 to 0.79 (except \u2018treatment control\u2019: 0.34); PedsQL teen-form domains from 0.70 to 0.93 and PedsQL parent-form domains from 0.72 to 0.95. All scales and subscales had low floor effects but some teen subscales yielded high ceiling effects. The SCD-specific scale and subscales showed high sensitivity as they varied significantly by severity of illness. Factor analysis of causal items on IPQ-R yielded a three-factor structure, explaining a total variance of 52.1%. The factors could be labelled as \u2018psychological\u2019, \u2018physical\u2019 and \u2018innate/behavioural risk factors\u2019. The teen QOL scores had significant negative correlations with the severity score (r: \u22120.46, p-value <0.001); IPQ identity domain (r: \u22120.42, p-value <0.001); IPQ consequences subscale (r: \u22120.36, p-value <0.001); IPQ cyclical timeline subscale (r: \u22120.31, p-value <0.001) and IPQ emotional representation subscale (r: \u22120.29, p-value <0.01). The severity index also had significant correlation with the QOL parent form (r: \u22120.44, p-value <0.001); IPQ identity domain (r: 0.43, p-value <0.01) and IPQ consequences domain (r: 0.35, p-value <0.001).\nIn conclusion, both the IPQ-R and PedsQL\u2122-SCD demonstrate robust psychometric properties in adolescents with SCD. Continuing longitudinal study will provide further assessment of the instruments such as \u2018responsiveness to change\u2019.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/17450128.2016.1139222", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Jamaican adolescents", "sickle cell disease", "quality of life", "illness perception", "psychometrics"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Anderson, M., & Asnani, M.

First, a Rosen\u2013Roback model is employed to estimate implicit values of amenities including climate, clean air and other natural attributes, which are used to generate QOL indices. Second, QOL, human capital represented by the share of college graduates, and their interaction serve as key variables in the wage growth model. An instrumental variable approach and location fixed effects are used to address endogeneity of human capital and control for location-specific unobservable characteristics. Results suggest that human capital and QOL significantly contribute to economic growth and the growth effects are even larger in nonmetropolitan counties. Importantly, we find that the effect of human capital on growth is larger in high-QOL counties and QOL enhances the effect of human capital on growth. Our results provide empirical support for community development strategies through providing utility-enhancing amenities that improve QOL and retain human capital.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00036846.2016.1173180", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Human capital", "quality of life", "natural amenities", "economic growth", "interactive effects", "JEL CLASSIFICATION:", "R10", "R11", "O10", "O44"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Aghion, P., P.

Our objective was to assess the asthma-related quality of life, using the mini Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ), in Lebanese asthmatic children, check its validity compared to the original version, and identify clinical and sociodemographic risk factors that might affect these children's QOL. \n: This retrospective study included 300 children aged between 7\u201316\u00a0years (51.6% boys and 48.4% girls). To confirm the mini-PAQLQ questionnaire construct validity in the Lebanese population, an exploratory factor analysis was launched for the 13 items of the questionnaire, using the principal component analysis technique. Cronbach's alpha was recorded for reliability analysis. A multivariate analysis linear regression was carried out, taking the QOL score as the dependent variable. \n: The correlation coefficients for factors 1 (symptoms and emotions) and 2 (activities) were similar to that of the original scale. High Cronbach's alphas were found for factor 1 (0.914), factor 2 (0.888), and the full scale (0.921). Uncontrolled asthma, the child's respiratory problems before the age of 2\u00a0years, and the presence of pets at home significantly decreased the children's asthma-related quality of life (Beta = \u22121.541; Beta = \u22126.846, and Beta = \u22125.364, respectively). \n: We were able to validate the mini-PAQLQ among the Lebanese population. The identification of risk factors, some of which are amenable to intervention, especially uncontrolled asthma, could lead to an improvement in the asthmatic children's QOL.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2018.1441417", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Lebanon", "mini-PAQLQ", "pets at home", "quality of life", "uncontrolled asthma"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": []}

The proposed methodology is illustrated, based mainly on recent large epidemiological studies carried out in Europe. The first study was carried out during 2002 and 2003 in eight European cities, with the main goal of analysing the effect of the immediate environment on health status. At the end of the second study, conducted in 2005\u20132006 in several cities, a perception scale for air quality was developed and validated. The last study, conducted in 2012\u20132014 within the local population of an industrial platform, had as its main objective the characterization of the impact of this industrial site on environment and health. Health related quality of life (HrQoL) is one of the most important outcomes measured in clinical trials over the past 20 years. More recently, it has also become important in epidemiological surveys, where, unlike clinical trials, the number of end points involved is generally large. The measurement and statistical analysis of HrQoL and/or risk perception remain important scientific issues. It is generally done mainly by internal consistency methods, because external standards or experts are generally not available. These methods are based mainly on the statistical validation of measurement models using goodness-of-fit tests. We will show in this paper how such validation can be done using the empirical backward reliability curve (the \n-curve).", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/17509653.2016.1151624", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Quality of life", "backward reliability curve", "unidimensionality", "Rasch family models", "risk perception", "big data", "JEL Classification:", "I18", "C35", "C43", "C51", "C52"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Andersen, E.

This paper presents results from research that analyses the well-being benefits gained by different sections of society through viewing, engaging with, and accessing woodlands and forests in Britain. We draw on 31 studies undertaken since 2001 and present a meta-analysis of quantitative data and a meta-synthesis of qualitative data to explore the range of benefits and associated activities in woodlands, and their social distribution. We also present a state-of-the-art typology of well-being benefits for woodlands in Britain. The findings illustrate the wide range of well-being benefits gained by different social groups through various forms of engagement with and activities undertaken in woodlands. We illustrate the wide range of meanings and values attached to trees and woodlands across different social groups. The evidence also illustrates how carefully designed and targeted interventions can be particularly effective in enabling and encouraging people to visit woodland sites, to participate or get involved in new activities and, therefore, to realise a range of well-being benefits.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2013.790354", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "social distribution", "quality of life", "cultural services", "woodland interventions", "woodland activities"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["BBC, 2011.

The purpose of this review was to analyze, based on a review of the current literature, the effects of physical activity on the quality of life (QoL) of subjects with asthma. \n. The authors conducted a search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) between January 2000 and August 2010 in a group of major databases of health sciences (Academic Search Complete, Directory of Open Access Journals, Elsevier\u2014Science Direct, Highwire Press, PubMed, Scielo Global, Scirus, Scopus, SpringerLink, Taylor & Francis, and Wiley Interscience) with the keywords \n and \n in all possible combinations. Citations and references of each study selected were also examined. \n. Of the 1075 studies identified, only 11 were included. Five of these studies were performed in children between the ages of 7 and 15 and the remaining studies were performed on adults. Intervention programs were divided into aerobic training programs and breathing exercises programs. All aerobic training programs showed improvements in QoL, demonstrating a positive influence of aerobic training on asthma. \n. There is a noticeable trend in the benefit of aerobic training programs in the QoL for individuals with asthma. The breathing exercises programs were few and heterogeneous, making it difficult to reach a positive conclusion on whether it could be recommended for the improvement of QoL in this pathology.

Cognitive variables such as knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy affect asthma patients' abilities to be effective self-managers. \n. The objective of this cross-sectional analysis was to determine what patient and clinical factors were associated with these cognitive variables and to assess the contributions of these cognitive variables to clinical status. \n. Primary care asthma patients were interviewed using the three domains of the Knowledge, Attitude, and Self-Efficacy Asthma Questionnaire (KASE), as well as established scales to measure social support, depressive symptoms, and ratings of asthma care. Clinical asthma status was measured with the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). \n. In total, 180 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 43 years and 84% were women. Knowledge was low, with only 50% of patients answering half or more questions correctly (mean score = 52, possible range 0\u2013100, higher is more knowledge). Attitude toward asthma was generally positive (mean score = 82, possible range 20\u2013100, higher is more positive attitude) and self-efficacy was moderate (mean score = 76, possible range 20\u2013100, higher is more self-efficacy). In separate multivariate analyses, younger age and higher education level were associated with more knowledge (\n \u2264 .005); more social support, fewer depressive symptoms, and more favorable prior results of asthma care were associated with more positive attitude (\n \u2264 .05); and favorable prior results, more satisfaction with asthma status, not having stress-related triggers, and not having had a recent emergency department visit for asthma were associated with more self-efficacy (\n \u2264 .07 for all variables). In additional multivariate analyses, more knowledge (\n = .0005), more positive attitude (\n = .02), and more self-efficacy (\n = .01) were associated with better AQLQ scores. \n. Different patient and clinical characteristics were associated with cognitive variables pertinent to self-management. These variables, in turn, were independently associated with asthma status. Thus, although fostering improvement in all three variables would be desirable, interventions that improve any of these variables potentially could be beneficial.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/02770903.2010.492540", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "asthma", "attitude", "cognitive variables", "knowledge", "quality of life", "self-efficacy", "self-management"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.

The aim of the present study was to investigate variables associated with subjective perception of health in older inpatients. Ninety elderly inpatients over 60 years old were interviewed. The perception of health assessment (healthy/unhealthy) allocated elders in either of two groups. All the elders answered sociodemographic questions, the WHOQOL-100 and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Comparing the group that considered themselves unhealthy to the other group, the former showed a tendency of worse QoL assessments in five out of six domains investigated. Significant differences were found for the physical and level of independence domains, as well as overall QoL. There was a significant association between health perception and lower intensity of depressive symptoms, as well as better QoL perception in the level of independence domain. This study shows the existence of an association between depressive symptoms and health assessment. It also suggests that the independence dimension is important in the elders\u2019 perception of their health status. These findings can help identify cause\u2013effect relations between variables in aging studies involving health indicators and bring new intervention proposals for the elderly.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00207594.2011.626046", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Subjective perception of health", "Elderly inpatients", "Quality of life", "Depression"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Beck, AT, Ward, CH, Mendelson, M, Mock, J and Erbaugh, J. 1961.

Our objective was to compare paper and electronic administration of the standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ(S)), Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ(S)), and Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ). Using a crossover design, adults and children with asthma and caregivers of children with asthma were recruited from clinics. Subjects were asked to complete both forms of the appropriate HRQOL measures at enrollment and 24\u201348 hours later. In addition, 30 subjects from each group were asked to participate in a 1-week reproducibility assessment of the electronic versions of the three questionnaires. Psychometric properties were assessed for each of the EDC versions. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Pearson correlations were calculated to compare EDC and paper versions. A total of 51 adults (mean age 37, 73% females), 52 children (mean age 13, 38% females), and 51 caregivers (mean age 43, 92% females) were evaluated. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) for the overall score of each questionnaire was: 0.96 for the AQLQ(S) and the PAQLQ(S), and 0.92 for the PACQLQ. Overall ICCs comparing paper with EDC were: 0.96 for the AQLQ(S), 0.91 for the PAQLQ(S), and 0.82 for the PACQLQ. Pearson's correlations were identical. One-week reproducibility (ICC) of the EDC versions was: 0.88 for the AQLQ(S), 0.78 for the PAQLQ(S), and 0.85 for the PACQLQ. When asked which method subjects preferred, the electronic version was chosen by 69% of adults, 77% of children, and 73% of caregivers. Additionally, 14% of adults, 14% of children, and 18% of caregivers reported no difference in preference.

Examples are drawn from adult acquired conditions (mainly aphasia), and terminology used in the paper reflects a rehabilitation stage of service provision. The World Health Organization's approach to quality of life definition and measurement is also discussed. An operational definition of quality of life for adults with acquired communication and swallowing disorders is presented, alongside an alternative conceptualization of quality of life. This paper ends with recommendations for future research concerning the importance of context, the subjective or personal perspective, and having a goals orientation for life as well as rehabilitation. It is also argued here that the ICF and quality of life are different constructs and that quality of life should be the starting point for understanding the client's perspective of his/her goals and/or his/her disability.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/17549500701790520", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "ICF", "World Health Organization", "speech-language pathology", "quality of life", "aphasia"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA).

However, more recently there has been greater interest in attending to the details of community development by capitalizing on the improved ability to capture community well-being and successes scientifically. That interest invites greater attention to the development of indicators that can quantify those qualities of life that lead to strong and healthy communities. The selection of meaningful indicators is dependent upon several factors including a process that stimulates meaningful involvement of community stakeholders, but the single most important is the identification of an underlying model to guide the work. Indicators do not have meaning in themselves. For these measures to provide a coherent assessment of the community, an integrative approach to understanding what constitutes a healthy and strong community in a dynamic environment is required. A resilience perspective serves that purpose and provides a framework that is broad, neutral, and conceptually strong enough to structure development of significant sets of indicators. Exemplary community indicator processes across the nation, particularly recent efforts in the Phoenix, Arizona region, provide evidence supporting the value of indicator development for community building.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/15575330809489673", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "community resilience", "quality of life", "community indicators", "analysis of social systems"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["American Psychiatric Association. 1994.

A review of the published literature was conducted, with quantitative/qualitative analysis as appropriate, to explore the direct, indirect, and hidden costs of allergic rhinitis, as well as the quality-of-life burdens that the disease presents to patients and to the healthcare system. Lack of treatment, undertreatment, or nonadherence\nto treatment in allergic rhinitis were seen to increase direct and indirect costs, reinforcing the need for patient education and for physicians to implement existing evidence-based guidelines for prevention and treatment. It was concluded that greater awareness of the total economic burden of allergic rhinitis should encourage appropriate intervention and ultimately ensure clinically favorable and cost-effective outcomes.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1185/030079903125003053", "keyword_list": ["Key Words::", "Allergic rhinitis", "Asthma", "Economics", "Health outcomes", "Prevalence", "Quality of life", "Sinusitis"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Dykewicz MS, Fineman S.

The incidence of COPD is high and ageing populations will see this continue and possibly increase. PR programs are effective, however, benefits may dissipate if the program is not continued. The maintenance program involved: strength retraining exercises; collaborative goal setting; regular telephone calls; and home visits. Around half of the 29 participants remained in contact with the program for 12 months and 21 completed final or 6-month assessment.

Outcomes provide knowledge for improving patient care through a home-based strategy to maintain benefits of PR programs.

The built environment of Canberra was strongly influenced by the Garden City concept in the early days and the New Town Development model in the 1960s and 1970s. While enhancing quality of life (QoL) is increasingly emphasised in urban planning, little empirical research has been done to assess how urban planning underpins this better QoL. This research examines the relationship between urban policy and QoL in Canberra by applying an integrated policy evaluation tool. The neighbourhoods of Canberra have been divided into seven districts for spatial analysis. The QoL level in each district was compared and the Belconnen and Tuggeranong districts were identified as achieving a lower QoL than other districts. Key indicators that were closely linked with the QoL level in these districts were identified. Using scenario analysis, the article identifies the changes to QoL in the two districts which could result from improving these key factors. The article proposes a method of mapping the interdisciplinary issues with the related urban policy and concludes with the implications for urban planning and further analysis.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01442872.2014.981059", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Canberra", "quality of life", "urban policy", "policy assessment tool", "policy mapping", "indicators"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Australian Bureau of Statistics. 2011.

Long-term efficacy of NAC 600mg/d in COPD is controversial; a dose-effect relationship has been demonstrated, but at present it is not known whether a higher dose provides clinical benefits. The PANTHEON Study is a prospective, ICS stratified, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of high-dose (1200 mg/daily) NAC treatment for one year in moderate-to-severe COPD patients. The primary endpoint is the annual exacerbation rate. Secondary endpoints include recurrent exacerbations hazard ratio, time to first exacerbation, as well as quality of life and pulmonary function. The hypothesis, design and methodology are described and baseline characteristics of recruited patients are presented. 1006 COPD patients (444 treated with maintenance ICS, 562 ICS naive, aged 66.27\u00b18.76 yrs, average post-bronchodilator FEV\n 48.95\u00b111.80 of predicted) have been randomized at 34 hospitals in China.

According to these notions, cities are suffering from an increasing deficit of green spaces and habitats. Green spaces and recreational areas are becoming a precious good within the urbanised world and a resource to preserve and enlarge if possible. Although a variety of urban \u2018green land uses\u2019 exists, this article focuses on examining their functionality in quantitative and qualitative terms using the concepts of quality of life and ecosystem services. We develop an integrative scheme that incorporates components of both concepts, and we ask further how they might be affected by uneven spatial development of shrinking cities possessing \u2018islands of growth\u2019. Using this approach we can show, first, that both concepts partially are complementary using similar variables, but following different mental models. Second, we make explicit the fact that shrinkage has positive as well as negative implications for urban green land use patterns and functionality.", "doi": "", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "urban green spaces", "recreational land use", "shrinkage", "ecosystem services", "quality of life"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Baumgart, M., Bertelli, U., Bognar, A. and Breuste, J.

A constant theme in QOL research in the last 30 years has been a focus on the measurement and the types of indicators utilized. The objective of this paper is to identify the structure, spatial variation, and change in quality of life from 1991 to 1996 within Saskatoon, Saskatchewan by using a range of indicators relating to the social and physical environment, modified by perception. The QOL model u ed was developed by combining aspects of Cutter's (1985) geographical model of quality of life and Myers' (1987) community of quality of life model to assess QOL over time from a geographical perspective. The integration of objective, subjective and perceptual indicators, using a survey of Saskatoon residents, allowed for a broader interpretation of quality of life than is normally the case. The structure of QOL identified from the results of a series of principal component analyses consistently identified two important structures, structures of general affluence and general disadvantage. Results showed that the most disadvantaged residents in 1991 and 1996 were living to the west of the Central Business District, clustered in several neighborhoods, while residents enjoying a higher QOL tended to live in the suburbs toward the periphery of Saskatoon.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.2747/0272-3638.24.8.691", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "quality of life", "socioeconomic indicators", "principal component analysis", "spatial analysis", "urban planning"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": [" Abrams, M., 1973, Subjective social indicator.

Sustainability indicators are already available but are characterized by a poor or absent theoretical underpinning. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a methodological framework that can be applied to the construction of indicators of sustainable development. In order to be consistent with widely accepted definitions of sustainable development, considerations relating to the measurement of quality of life and ecological integrity are central to the methodology. The methodological framework has relevance to a variety of spatial scales and to geographically diverse areas (urban or rural, developed or developing countries) so that a suite of sustainability indicators can be produced that is tailored to the needs and resources of the indicator user, but which remains rooted firmly in the fundamental principles of sustainable development.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13504509509469893", "keyword_list": ["sustainable development", "indicator", "quality of life", "ecological integrity", "", "Agenda 21", "", "PICABUE"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Alexander, J.

However, they are often selected without considering their effect on each other and the achievement of sustainability. Indeed, two decades after the definition of sustainable development, there is still little agreement on principles of sustainability, nor the indicators to represent them. Part of the difficulty lies in working from a present unsustainable state to an uncertain future horizon. An alternative is to apply backcasting, which starts from a desired outcome and develops scenarios for achieving it. This paper presents a framework of sustainability principles to help operationalize indicators and increase their relevance. It outlines how this can be done using backcasting to evaluate existing indicators or to select those that relate positively to the framework principles. Although there is no formula for achieving sustainability, this process provides a format for discussion in selecting indicators and in ensuring their continued relevance to sustainable development progress.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13504501003726974", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "frameworks", "targets", "key indicators", "quality of life", "first-order principle", "heterarchical"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Ahlroth, S and H\u00f6jer, M. 2007.

The author investigates the ethical obligations to sustainability through a schema of four ethical theories and matching those standards to three levels: economic, social and environmental. The commentary put forward will argue that the ethical reasoning works as a more effective stimulant for countries to embrace sustainable agendas, where the law has so far failed.\nWith the sweeping winds of change (Arab Spring) blowing in the Middle East region since the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia followed by the widely idealized revolution in Egypt; this article explains the paradoxical opportunity which developing countries as such hold now in adopting radical change and starting a whole new wave of sustainable strategies, which in the long term will present themselves as a huge leap forward towards a better future.\nEconomic and business benefits are linked to a better quality of life socially and environmentally, where the laws have failed to deliver, and ethical reasoning emerges as a powerful tool forward as it did drive the revolutions asking for radical change.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/19463138.2012.723007", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "sustainable development", "ethical reasoning", "quality of life", "utilitarian", "deontological", "virtue", "social justice", "Rawlsian", "political reform", "ethical sustainability"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": [" Bahaa El Din Z. 2011 Mar 8.

Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 101 people with refractive error. Thematic analysis was used with matrices produced to compare the occurrence of themes and categories across participants. Themes were identified using an inductive approach.\n: Seven major themes emerged that determined refractive error-specific QoL: activity limitation, inconvenience, health concerns, psycho-social impact, economic impact, general and ocular comfort symptoms, and visual symptoms. Activity limitation, economic impact, and symptoms were the most important themes for the participants with URE, whereas inconvenience associated with wearing glasses was the most important issue in glasses wearers. Similarly, possibilities of having side effects or complications were the major concerns for participants wearing contact lens. In general, refractive surgery addressed socio-emotional impact of wearing glasses or contact lens. However, the surgery participants had concerns such as possibility of having to wear glasses again due to relapse of refractive error.\n: Impact of refractive error on people\u2019s QoL is multifaceted. Significance of the identified themes varies by refractive error subgroups. Refractive correction may not always address QoL impact of URE but often add unique QoL issues. This study findings also provide content for developing an item-bank for quantitatively measuring refractive error-specific QoL in developing country setting.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09286586.2017.1376338", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Refractive error", "myopia", "hyperopia", "presbyopia", "eyeglasses", "contact lens", "laser refractive surgery", "quality of life", "qualitative study", "thematic analysis"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Bourne RRA, Stevens GA, White RA, et al.

This paper investigates quality of life in Italian cities using the hedonic approach. It analyses micro-level data for housing and labour markets to estimate compensating differentials for local amenities within four domains: weather, environment, services and society. Large compensating differentials in housing markets are found, whereas the effects on wages are relatively small. Quality of life varies substantially across space and is generally better in large and medium-sized cities of the Centre\u2013North. Services and social conditions are strongly related to overall quality of life. It is also found that, across cities, quality of life is positively and significantly related to subjective well-being.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00343404.2012.712206", "keyword_list": ["Quality of life", "Hedonic prices", "Housing markets", "Well-being", "\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf", "\u4eab\u4e50(\u7279\u5f81)\u4ef7\u683c", "\u4f4f\u5b85\u5e02\u573a", "\u5e78\u798f", "Qualit\u00e9 de la vie", "Prix h\u00e9donistiques", "March\u00e9s du logement", "Bien-\u00eatre", "Lebensqualit\u00e4t", "Hedonische Preise", "Wohnungsm\u00e4rkte", "Wohlbefinden", "Calidad de vida", "Precios hed\u00f3nicos", "Mercados de la vivienda", "Bienestar", "JEL classifications::", "C4", "D5", "H4", "J3", "J6", "Q2", "R2"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Albouy D.

Moreover, studies have found that ciclesonide is as effective as other ICSs in establishing and controlling disease symptoms.

The aim of this study was to examine quality of life (QoL) and economic consequences of SAC amongst private health care patients in Spain. \n: 201 sufferers of SAC and 200 controls were recruited from four private eye clinics and one public hospital in five Spanish cities: Alicante, Madrid, Albacete, Las Palmas de Gran Canarias and Valladolid. Participants were between 10 and 80 years of age and Spanish speaking. All potential participants were asked selected questions and sorted into one of the two groups or excluded. Sufferers were administered a set of four questionnaires by researchers consisting of the EQ-5D Health Questionnaire, the National Eye Institute (US) Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25 (VFQ-25), the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) and a Health Economic and Demographic Questionnaire (HEDQ). Control participants self-administered the full EQ-5D and VFQ-25 and abbreviated versions of the RQLQ and HEDQ. \n: The groups were comparable in terms of age and sex, but sufferers had a significantly higher hourly income than controls (p = 0.02). Sufferers exhibited a significantly higher incidence of asthma, nasal symptoms, perennial allergic conjunctivitis, food allergies and other allergies (p < 0.01 for all comorbidities). Sufferers returned significantly lower quality of life scores than controls in all EQ-5D domains other than mobility (p = 0.14). SAC VFQ-25 scores were significantly less than in controls in the overall vision (p < 0.01), distance vision (p < 0.01), ocular pain (p < 0.01), mental health (p = 0.01), role limitations (p < 0.01), and dependency (p = 0.01) domains. Mean scores for the activity domain of the RQLQ were greater in the sufferer group than the control group (P < 0.01) . The total mean per-sufferer cost of SAC amongst our sample of private patients was 348.50 Euros. \n: Sufferers experienced QoL reductions in general health and specific aspects of vision as a result of their SAC. In relative terms, the per-capita economic cost of the condition was higher than in a previous public health care study. This was ascribed to sufferers' willingness-to-pay for symptom alleviation. The unexpectedly high expenditure of the proportion of SAC sufferers who receive private health care serves to highlight the importance of SAC as a costly condition. It also illustrates the need to account for both private and public heath care modalities when attempting to ascribe a total cost to a medical condition.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09286580590967781", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis", "quality of life", "economic impact", "health care costs", "questionnaire study", "Spain"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Malone D C, Lawson K A, Smith D H, Arrighi H M, Battista C.

These have unexpected environmental consequences in local and global scale. The need to increase energy supply in a developing country like India is unquestionable. To meet the proposed energy needs, India must produce nearly double the quantity of coal (550 Mt/y) by 2010 AD, as it is mining at present. Rapid growth of the energy sector has made environmental protection a highly complex and more difficult task. There is a pressing need for alternate sustainable supplies of energy. This article examines the energy resources and some of the key environmental issues in these sectors. The focus is on the options available for the supply of energy. Geothermal energy, its potential, recovery, present scenario of utilization and its utility as a cleaner source have been discussed. The development of non-conventional energy in Indian context has been described.

This research focuses on farm animals\u2019 husbandry in cities as a type of local food production. Debates about governance tools for sustaining such economic sector arise frequently especially in Egypt, as one of the developing countries, striving to maintain urban quality of life, satisfy the community needs, and compensate the food prices\u2019 increment. Accordingly, field questionnaires for residents of two rapidly expanding informal areas in Cairo (Zabaleen area in Agouza city) and (Masaken Osman in 6th of October city), together with questionnaires for experts and officials who are working in Urban Upgrading Units and those with experiences in the field of upgrading informal settlements were performed. This research thus aims at studying the feasibility and integration of such economic activities informally developing in unplanned areas in Egypt, as \u2018new ruralism\u2019, within the strategic and action planning of low-income and informal areas in a legalized regulatory system to tackle their challenges and enhance their economic role. Further, this research ends up with deducing specific values for prioritizing the types of governmental support (financial, space facilitations, social, and medical), as proposed by officials and residents representing the main incorporated stakeholders. This article also highlighted the unwillingness and the on-purpose ignorance of officials to sustain animal husbandry in cities, constituting a challenge that needs to be tackled in all developing countries not only in Egypt.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/17535069.2017.1298000", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Animal husbandry", "productive landscape", "life", "", "quality", "governance"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Veterinary in Agriculture Administration, Information center, Haram, Giza, Egypt (2016, May).

The purpose of the restoration was to improve the quality of cultural and environmental life in central Seoul, thus making the urban environment more attractive for residents while creating a more favorable economic climate. The restoration was based on a top-down vision but leaders tried to win over residents by providing broad benefits. The project improved the air quality in the area, provided more green space and an artificial urban waterway, improved traffic flow through the area, and has contributed to the improvement of Seoul's image and helped promote its tourism. On the other hand, the project went over budget, met some protest, promoted gentrification, and involved more of an historical and environmental reimagining than a restoration. The perceived success of the project helped Mayor Lee win the presidency, but he was unable to replicate the project on a nationwide scale and the new environmental/cultural development model heralded by the project has quickly receded, replaced by a new focus on welfare.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/10630732.2013.855511", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Cheonggyecheon restoration", "city image", "urban development", "urban environment", "quality", "of urban", "life"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["C.

The purpose of this research is twofold: (1) to compare two weighting and aggregation techniques, data envelopment analysis (DEA) and principal components analysis (PCA), in the development of a socioeconomic index; and (2) to test for and explore spatial variation in the relationship between socioeconomic index and environmental variables using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The analysis was conducted at the census block group level in Massachusetts. First, DEA and PCA were used to generate two separate socioeconomic indexes. Second, the relationship between these indexes and environmental variables including percentage impervious surface, percentage industrial land use, percentage land used for waste, and traffic density was modeled using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and GWR. The GWR models explained more variance in the relationship than the OLS models and indicated that there is considerable spatial variation in the character and the strength of this relationship. The results of the GWR analyses were similar between the models generated using DEA- and PCA-derived indexes, indicating that the results were corroborative. The study concludes that the environmental variables are generally a strong predictor of the socioeconomic conditions at the scale of census block group; however, there is substantial geographical variation in the strength and the character of this relationship. The results of this study also suggest that various weighting and aggregation methods should be tested in every study that uses or creates composite indicators.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00330124.2011.639631", "keyword_list": ["Key Words:", "data envelopment analysis", "geographically weighted regression", "Massachusetts", "quality", "of", "life", "socioeconomic conditions", "\u5173\u952e\u8bcd:", "\u6570\u636e\u5305\u7edc\u5206\u6790", "\u5730\u7406\u52a0\u6743\u56de\u5f52", "\u9a6c\u8428\u8bf8\u585e\u5dde", "\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf", "\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "Palabras clave:", "an\u00e1lisis envolvente de datos", "regresi\u00f3n geogr\u00e1ficamente ponderada", "Massachusetts", "calidad de vida", "condiciones socio-econ\u00f3micas"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Anselin, L. 1995.

As the rate of decline in lung function may be faster in the initial stages of the disease, early intervention could be beneficial to control symptoms and affect disease progression and outcomes. A systematic review of published literature relating to mild-to-moderate COPD (patients with FEV\n \u226550% predicted) was performed to evaluate the level of impairment and natural history or disease progression over time, and impact of interventions on the outcomes of patients with early-stage disease. Of the 79 published articles included in this analysis, 31 reported randomized controlled trials; the remaining 48 articles reported studies of non-randomized and/or observational design. Nine of the randomized controlled trials were \u22656 months\u2019 duration, enabling assessment of outcomes over time. Most of the randomized controlled trials were in patients with moderate COPD (GOLD stage II); few included patients with the mildest stages of the disease (i.e., stage I). The results show that even patients with milder or moderate COPD can have substantial limitations and physical impairment, which worsen over time. Encouragement of smoking cessation, in conjunction with management of symptoms and treating activity limitation and exacerbations by appropriate non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management at the earliest possible stage, could positively affect the impact and progression of the disease.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3109/15412555.2012.719048", "keyword_list": ["Keywords\u2002:", "Bronchodilator Agents", "Quality of Life", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Exacerbations", "GOLD Stage I", "GOLD Stage II."], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease.

Advances in science have led to increased understanding of the heterogeneous nature of asthma and its complex mechanisms. Traditionally, asthma-practice guidelines have focused on optimizing lung function and the US FDA has required increases in lung function and reduction of exacerbation as primary outcomes in clinical trials of new asthma therapeutics. Improved lung function is a critical indicator of bronchodilator therapy, but the importance of long-term asthma control while maintained on controller medication is increasingly emphasized. The NIH asthma guidelines suggest the use of patient-reported outcomes, including health-related quality-of-life measures, to assess asthma control. Clinical practices and research studies concerning asthma can benefit from harmonizing the major outcome measures so that comparisons across studies can be made.

Several risk measures, such as \n-diagrams, probability of loss of life and days of lost life expectancy are introduced. All of the mentioned risk measures are specialized for different types of loss. In addition, quality of life parameters can be understood as a risk measure. In contrast to the former mentioned risk measures this risk measure is able to cover the entire field of risk to humans. If this is true then all safety actions, such as the strengthening of bridges, regardless of their specific field can be compared subject to their efficiency. This would permit the competition of safety actions over the entire society and should yield an improvement not only to the safety of humans, but also to an increase in the quality of life inside a society.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/15732470701189472", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "Risk measures", "Quality", "-of-", "life", "parameters", "Safety action"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Ahrens, A. and Leininger, N. 2003.  \u201cPsychometrische Lebensqualit\u00e4tsmessung anhand von Frageb\u00f6gen\u201d.

Therefore some most reliable, inexpensive, at the site and easy methods are sort after. Whereas water quality assessment kits are portable and used at the site, they too have certain limitations of accuracy and the laboratory tests are more laborious, time consuming as well as prone to miscalculations due to time gaps and mismanagement. Therefore in developed world some natural parameters are now used as indices of water quality. These are the macro-invertebrates which are living at the bed of a water body and they are filter feeders. These species mainly depend on the type of water quality in that particular stream. They are different for fresh waters and different for \n waters. And accordingly there population per unit square area differs. They are termed as biotic indices and currently there are quite a few such methods available for particular regions in the European countries. But developing countries have yet to practice those methods and check their validity as well as apply correction factors for their parts of the world, except for a few south American countries.\nThis paper contains a brief description of those methods, besides the findings, results and conclusions of an attempt made for the first time to identify such Taxa-macro-invertebrates-, vis-\u00e0-vis the water quality tests done with the help of portable kits and standard lab tests, of a main fresh water stream-Dachigam Nallah-in Srinagar the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, India. This stream supplies drinking water to major portion of the Srinagar city. Dachigam Nallah is coming directly from glaciers, flowing through the hilly terrain and ravines for a long run from the origin of the channel having almost no \n interventions of humans. Satellite picture (Fig. 2) of the stream shows green colour of water which supports pristine condition of water. The type of Taxa found is tabulated in Table 1. The physical and chemical tests for 17 parameters were conducted and the test results are tabulated in Table 2. The relationship of Taxa to water quality was tried by the use of four different biotic index methods. Those results are presented under the heading, \u201cRESULTS\u201d. It was concluded that use of such methods could prove quite beneficial for developing world and agencies UNEP, OSDA, WHO etc. are ready to help such projects.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09715010.2009.10514935", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Taxa: Macro-invertebrates", "living", "on substrata of streams/water bodies", "Key Indicator:", "The main Taxa which indicate water", "quality", "Filter feeders: The organisms who feed themselves by the special mechanism of filtering the surrounding water to separate edible food particles for themselves.

Different factors affect this control, and there are several regional differences, both in terms of prevalence and in terms of management and degree of control. \n To evaluate the factors associated with control of severe asthma in routine clinical practice. \n This was a prospective, cross-sectional, observational study of patients with severe asthma who were receiving treatment with a fixed combination of a corticosteroid (at least 800 \u03bcg/day of budesonide or equivalent) and an inhaled \u03b2\n-adrenergic agonist in respiratory medicine and allergology clinics throughout Spain. The authors collected demographic and socioeconomic data, as well as clinical data on asthma. The patients also completed a self-administered validated questionnaire\u2014the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)\u2014about the control of their asthma. \n The authors included 1471 patients, of whom 1224 (83%) were valid for the final analysis. Women accounted for 61%. Mean age was 51 \u00b1 16 years. The mean number of exacerbations during the previous year was 2.0 \u00b1 2.0.

Only 20.4% of patients were well controlled (ACQ < 0.75), and 55.7% of patients were poorly controlled (ACQ > 1.5). The multivariate analysis revealed that the variable with the greatest effect on control of asthma was the number of exacerbations during the previous year: when the number of exacerbations increased from 0 to 1 or more, the ACQ score increased by 0.56 points. Employed patients had a mean of 0.23 points less (better control) than unemployed and retired patients. Control of asthma was also significantly affected by adherence to treatment, patient knowledge of the disease, body mass index, gender, and number of visits to a physician in the previous 3 months. \n Many patients with severe asthma have poor control of their disease.

Half reported a history of depression or other psychiatric co-morbidities, 57% presented depressive symptoms, and 69% reported fatigue. FIS and CES-D scores accounted for 54% and 66% of total variance in psychological QOL and level of independence-related QOL, respectively, in a multivariate analysis adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and alcohol or drug use. High FIS scores were independently associated with impaired physical QOL and social relationships, whereas high CES-D scores were independently associated with lower environmental QOL. \n Self-reported fatigue and depressive symptoms are the best indicators of co-infected patients\u2019 QOL.

Two comorbidity-related variables, the occurrence of the specific comorbidity and the total number of comorbidities, were used to comprehensively reflect the characteristics of comorbidity.\n Approximately 60% of participants had at least one comorbid disease, and osteoporosis was the most prevalent comorbidity. HRQOL differences based on the occurrence of a specific comorbidity were evident for arthritis, eye/vision problems, dental and gum problems, lymphedema, and psychological difficulties. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that the nature of the outcome variable, either physical or mental HRQOL, influenced the overall patterns of the findings. For example, life stress was significantly associated with the total number of comorbidities and in turn influenced physical HRQOL. In terms of mental HRQOL, arthritis, dental and gum problems, chronic pain, heart disease, lymphedema, and psychological difficulties mediated the relationship between life stress and mental HRQOL.\n The current study adds to the existing literature by examining the mediating effects of comorbidity on the relationship between life stress and HRQOL. The findings support the need for health care professionals to clearly assess physical and psychological comorbidities when providing survivorship care for cancer survivors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2016.1246428", "keyword_list": ["KEYWORDS:", "Chinese-Americans", "breast cancer survivors", "comorbidity", "health-related", "quality", "of", "life", "Korean-Americans", "life", "stress"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["American Cancer Society. 2016.

At the same time, the ecological and social risks and benefits related to the increasing production of bioenergy are not yet fully understood. From a social perspective, bioenergy has often been promoted as a promising development strategy for rural development. Little research, however, has explicitly addressed questions as to whether the current developments in bioenergy production actually lead to noticeable changes in rural living conditions. In this article we thus present the results of an exploratory investigation of the perceived impacts of bioenergy production on the quality of life of the rural population in the federal state of Brandenburg, Germany. For this purpose, a survey instrument was developed based on the theoretical concept of quality of life adapted specifically for the case of bioenergy. The analysis revealed that the perceptions of impacts on general living conditions in the region are considerably more pronounced than perceptions of impacts on the personal living environment. Statistically significant linkages between the impacts of bioenergy and life satisfaction could be identified primarily for nature and ecology-related effects.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13511610.2016.1192991", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "energy from biomass", "social impacts", "perceived", "quality", "of", "life", "rural population"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Altman, D.

To maintain a secure level and combustion efficiency, a \u201ccoal combustion life cycle online monitoring system\u201d (CLMS) has been developed and installed on a 215MW boiler in China. Ten temperature detectors have been installed at the heights of three-layer burners along the furnace. To improve the accuracy of measuring unburnt carbon in fly ash, an adjustable microwave test facility was established. An on-line measurement device for unburnt carbon in ash has been newly developed and attached to the convection flue gas pass. To optimize combustion processes, a real-time neural network prediction model for coal calorific value has been developed. By calculating and analyzing the data in computer workstations, safety evaluation of burner ignition, economic analysis and energy loss analysis can be obtained in real time. As for fluctuation in coal quality, application of the system has improved boiler efficiency more than 1.0%, and reduced NO\n by ~10\u201315%.", "doi": "", "keyword_list": ["Keywords::", "coal", "quality", "life", "cycle", "on-line monitoring", "combustion optimization."], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["K.

Positive perceptions of green and open space were identified as important predictors of high levels of neighbourhood satisfaction, surpassed only by dwelling characteristics.

This study examined whether cognitive symptoms and health-related quality of life can be affected by welding fume exposure. \n. Participants consisted of welders (\n\u2009=\u200940) and welder assistants (\n\u2009=\u200925) from welding units as the exposed group, and office workers (\n\u2009=\u200944) as the non-exposed group. All participants were studied using ambient air monitoring and two types of questionnaires: the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). \n. Welders and welder assistants were exposed to higher concentrations of all airborne metals than office employees, except for aluminum and chromium (\n\u2009<\u20090.05). Mean (95% confidence interval) CFQ score was higher in welders (26.42 (12.74)) compared with welder assistants (22.68 (14.37)) and the non-exposed group (21.38 (8.75)), although these differences were not statistically significant. Mean total score of the SF-36 significantly differed among the three groups (\n\u2009<\u20090.05) and welders had the lowest score (\n (\n)\u2009=\u200954.84 (17.88)). The relationships between total CFQ score and the measured concentration of nickel at peak work rate was significant for welders. \n. Cognitive symptoms and health-related quality of life were not related to the measures of welding fume exposure and further research should be performed to find other influencing factors.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/10803548.2016.1164499", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "welding fume", "ambient air assessment", "cognitive failures", "health-related", "quality", "of", "life"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Flynn MR, Susi P.

In so doing, we test the thesis that the economic development priorities of women city leaders will reflect postmaterialist values; in other words, women city leaders will place more of an emphasis on quality-of-life issues than do men. We employ results of a survey of more than 150 city leaders in Texas. Our findings offer support for our postmaterialist thesis and indicate that while women differ little from men in terms of traditional economic development considerations, such as the importance of job creation and revenue generation, women more than men also consider the influence of economic development efforts on a community's environment and aesthetics.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/1554477X.2011.589289", "keyword_list": ["Keywords:", "women", "city leaders", "economic development", "postmaterialist values", "traditional values", "Texas", "cities", "economic development priorities", "quality", "-of-", "life", "issues"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Lynn, Bachelor. 1994.

The development, expansion and synthesis of person-environment and ecological models provides the theoretical foundation. Central to this discussion is the identification and elaboration of salutogenic and pathogenic pathways (Antonovsky, 1979) through which the built environment may influence health, functioning and longevity. Research and knowledge drawn from literature on relocation, housing characteristics and well-being, the meaning of home, delay of institutionalization, technological devices, falls and other injuries, and healthy communities is used to demonstrate environmental pathways to health and longevity.", "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1300/J081v19n02_04", "keyword_list": ["Key Words:", "Influence of the built environment", "health status", "older persons", "quality", "and quantity of", "life", "salutogenic and pathogenic pathways", "health functioning and longevity"], "citation_count": 0, "reference_list": ["Ahacic, K., Parker, M. and Thorslund, M. 2000.
